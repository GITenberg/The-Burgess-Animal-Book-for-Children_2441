    <h2>
      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The cordial reception given the Burgess Bird Book for Children, together
      with numerous letters to the author asking for information on the habits
      and characteristics of many of the mammals of America, led to the
      preparation of this volume. It is offered merely as an introduction to the
      four-footed friends, little and big, which form so important a part of the
      wild life of the United States and Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been no attempt to describe or classify sub-species. That is for
      the scientist and student with specific interests. The purpose of this
      book is to acquaint the reader with the larger groups&mdash;orders,
      families, and divisions of the latter, so that typical representatives may
      be recognized and their habits understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of the word mammal, the word animal has been used throughout as
      having a better defined meaning to the average child. A conscientious
      effort to avoid technical terms and descriptions has been made that there
      may be nothing to confuse the young mind. Clarity and simplicity have been
      the objects kept constantly in view.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time the utmost care to be accurate in the smallest details
      has been exercised. To this end the works of leading authorities on
      American mammals have been carefully consulted and compared. No statements
      which are not confirmed by two or more naturalists of recognized standing
      have been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this research work the writings of Audubon and Bachman, Dr. E.W. Neson,
      Dr. C. Hart Merriam, Dr. W.T. Hornaday, Ernest Thompson Seton and others,
      together with the bulletins of the Biological Survey of the Department of
      Agriculture at Washington, have been of the greatest value. I herewith
      acknowledge my debt to these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the text may lack in clearness of description will be amply
      compensated for by the wonderful drawings in color and black-an-white by
      Mr. Louis Agassiz Fuertes, the artist-naturalist, whose hearty cooperation
      has been a source of great help to me. These drawings were made especially
      for this book and add in no small degree to such value as it may possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reading of these pages shall lead even a few to an active interest
      in our wild animals, stimulating a desire to preserve and protect a
      priceless heritage from the past which a heedless present threatens
      through wanton and reckless waste to deny the future, the labor will have
      been well worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only through intimate acquaintance may understanding of the animals in
      their relations to each other and to man be attained. To serve as a medium
      for this purpose this book has been written. As such I offer it to the
      children of America, conscious of its shortcomings yet hopeful that it
      will prove of some value in acquainting them with their friends and mine&mdash;the
      animals of field and wood, of mountain and desert, in the truest sense the
      first citizens of America. THORNTON W. BURGESS

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I Jenny Wren Gives Peter Rabbit an Idea
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as you're alive now, Peter Rabbit, some day I will catch you,&rdquo;
       snarled Reddy Fox, as he poked his black nose in the hole between the
      roots of the Big Hickory-tree which grows close to the Smiling Pool. &ldquo;It
      is lucky for you that you were not one jump farther away from this hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter, safe inside that hole, didn't have a word to say, or, if he did, he
      didn't have breath enough to say it. It was quite true that if he had been
      one jump farther from that hole, Reddy Fox would have caught him. As it
      was, the hairs on Peter's funny white tail actually had tickled Reddy's
      back as Peter plunged frantically through the root-bound entrance to that
      hole. It had been the narrowest escape Peter had had for a long, long
      time. You see, Reddy Fox had surprised Peter nibbling sweet clover on the
      bank of the Smiling Pond, and it had been a lucky thing for Peter that
      that hole, dug long ago by Johnny Chuck's grandfather, had been right
      where it was. Also, it was a lucky thing that old Mr. Chuck had been wise
      enough to make the entrance between the roots of that tree in such a way
      that it could not be dug any larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reddy Fox was too shrewd to waste any time trying to dig it larger. He
      knew there wasn't room enough for him to get between those roots. So,
      after trying to make Peter as uncomfortable as possible by telling him
      what he, Reddy, would do to him when he did catch him, Reddy trotted off
      across the Green Meadows. Peter remained where he was for a long time.
      When he was quite sure that it was safe to do so, he crept out and
      hurried, lipperty-lipperty-lip, up to the Old Orchard. He felt that that
      would be the safest place for him, because there were ever so many hiding
      places in the old stone wall along the edge of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter reached the Old Orchard, who should he see but Jenny Wren.
      Jenny had arrived that very morning from the Sunny South where she had
      spent the winter. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny as soon as
      she saw Peter. &ldquo;If here isn't Peter Rabbit himself! How did you manage to
      keep out of the clutches of Reddy Fox all the long winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled. &ldquo;I didn't have much trouble with Reddy during the winter,&rdquo;
       said he, &ldquo;but this very morning he so nearly caught me that it is a wonder
      that my hair is not snow white from fright.&rdquo; Then he told Jenny all about
      his narrow escape. &ldquo;Had it not been for that handy hole of Grandfather
      Chuck, I couldn't possibly have escaped,&rdquo; concluded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren cocked her pert little head on one side, and her sharp little
      eyes snapped. &ldquo;Why don't you learn to swim, Peter, like your cousin down
      in the Sunny South?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;If he had been in your place, he would
      simply have plunged into the Smiling Pool and laughed at Reddy Fox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter sat bolt upright with his eyes very wide open. In them was a funny
      look of surprise as he stared up at Jenny Wren. &ldquo;What are you talking
      about, Jenny Wren?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Don't you know that none of the Rabbit
      family swim unless it is to cross the Laughing Brook when there is no
      other way of getting to the other side, or when actually driven into the
      water by an enemy from whom there is no other escape? I can swim a little
      if I have to, but you don't catch me in the water when I can stay on land.
      What is more, you won't find any other members of my family doing such a
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut, Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Jenny Wren in her sharp, scolding
      voice. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, tut! For a fellow who has been so curious about the
      ways of his feathered neighbors, you know very little about your own
      family. If I were in your place I would learn about my own relatives
      before I became curious about my neighbors. How many relatives have you,
      Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly, &ldquo;my big cousin, Jumper the Hare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren threw back her head and laughed and laughed and laughed. It was
      a most irritating and provoking laugh. Finally Peter began to lose
      patience. &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; he demanded crossly. &ldquo;You know very
      well that Jumper the Hare is the only cousin I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren laughed harder that ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Peter, you will be the death of me. Why, down in the
      Sunny South, where I spent the winter, you have a cousin who is more
      closely related to you than Jumper the Hare. And what is more, he is
      almost as fond of the water as Jerry Muskrat. He was called the Marsh
      Rabbit or Marsh Hare, and many a time I have watched him swimming about by
      the hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it!&rdquo; declared Peter angrily. &ldquo;I don't believe a word of
      it. You are simply trying to fool me, Jenny Wren. There never was a Rabbit
      and there never will be a Rabbit who would go swimming for the fun of it.
      I belong to the Cottontail branch of the Hare family, and it is a fine
      family if I do say so. My cousin Jumper is a true Hare, and the only
      difference between us is that he is bigger, has longer legs and ears,
      changes the color of his coat in winter, and seldom, if ever, goes into
      holes in the ground. The idea of trying to tell me I don't know about my
      own relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jenny Wren suddenly became sober. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said she very earnestly, &ldquo;take
      my advice and go to school to Old Mother Nature for awhile. What I have
      told you is true, every word of it. You have a cousin down in the Sunny
      South who spends half his time in the water. What is more, I suspect that
      you and Jumper have other relatives of whom you've never heard. Such
      ignorance would be laughable if it were not to be pitied. This is what
      comes of never having traveled. Go to school to Old Mother Nature for a
      while, Peter. It will pay you.&rdquo; With this, Jenny Wren flew away to hunt
      for Mr. Wren that they might decide where to make their home for the
      summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter tried to believe that what Jenny Wren had told him was nothing but a
      story, but do what he would, he couldn't rid himself of a little doubt. He
      tried to interest himself in the affairs of the other little people of Old
      Orchard, but it was useless. That little doubt kept growing and growing.
      Could it be possible that Jenny Wren had spoken the truth? Could it be
      that he really didn't know what relatives he had or anything about them?
      Of course Old Mother Nature could tell him all he wanted to know. And he
      knew that whatever she might tell him would be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally that growing doubt, together with the curiosity which has led poor
      Peter to do so many queer things, proved too much for him and he started
      for the Green Forest to look for Old Mother Nature. It didn't take long to
      find her. She was very busy, for there is no time in all the year when Old
      Mother Nature has quite so much to do as in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Old Mother Nature,&rdquo; said Peter timidly but very politely,
      &ldquo;I've some questions I want to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled in a kindly way. &ldquo;All right, Peter,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;I guess I can talk and work at the same time. What is it you
      want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know if it is true that there are any other members of the
      Rabbit and the Hare family besides my big cousin, Jumper, who lives here
      in the Green Forest, and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled more than ever. &ldquo;Why, of course, Peter,&rdquo;
       she replied. &ldquo;There are several other members. You ought to know that. But
      then, I suppose you don't because you never have traveled. It is
      surprising how little some folks know about the very things they ought to
      know most about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked very humble and as if he felt a little bit foolish. &ldquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;is
      it true that way down in the Sunny South I have a cousin who loves to
      spend his time in the water?&rdquo; stammered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is, Peter,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is called the
      Marsh Rabbit, and he is more nearly your size, and looks more like you,
      than any of your other cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter gulped as if he were swallowing something that went down hard. &ldquo;That
      is what Jenny Wren said, but I didn't believe her,&rdquo; replied Peter meekly.
      &ldquo;She said she had often watched him swimming about like Jerry Muskrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;Quite true. Quite true,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He is quite
      as much at home in the water as on land, if anything a little more so. He
      is one member the family who takes to the water, and he certainly does
      love it. Is there anything else you want to know, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shifted about uneasily and hesitated. &ldquo;What is it, Peter?&rdquo; asked Old
      Mother Nature kindly. &ldquo;There is nothing in the Great World equal to
      knowledge, and if I can add to your store of it I will be very glad to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter took heart. &ldquo;If&mdash;if you please, Mother Nature, I would like to
      learn all about my family. May come to school to you every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed right out. &ldquo;Certainly you may go to school to
      me, old Mr. Curiosity,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;It is a good idea; a very good idea.
      I'm very busy, as you can see, but I'm never too busy to teach those who
      really want to learn. We'll have a lesson here every morning just at
      sun-up. I can't be bothered any more to-day, because it is late. Run along
      home to the dear Old Briar-patch and think up some questions to ask me
      to-morrow morning. And, by the way, Peter, I will ask YOU some questions.
      For one thing I shall ask you to tell me all you know about your own
      family. Now scamper along and be here to-morrow morning at sun-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I bring my cousin, Jumper the Hare, if he wants to come?&rdquo; asked
      Peter, as he prepared to obey Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring him along and any one else who wants to learn,&rdquo; replied Old Mother
      Nature kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter bade her good-by in his most polite manner and then scampered as
      fast as he could go, lipperty-lipperty-lip, to the dear Old Briar-patch.
      There he spent the remainder of the day thinking up questions and also
      trying to find out how much he really did know about his own family.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II Peter and Jumper go to School
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hardly had jolly, round, red Mr. Sun thrown off his rosy blankets and
      begun his daily climb up in the blue, blue sky when Peter Rabbit and his
      cousin, Jumper the Hare, arrived at the place in the Green Forest where
      Peter had found Old Mother Nature the day before. She was waiting for
      them, ready to begin the first lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you are so prompt,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Promptness is one of the most
      important things in life. Now I am very, very busy these days, as you
      know, so we will begin school at once. Before either of you ask any
      questions, I am going to ask some myself. Peter, what do you look like?
      Where do you live? What do you eat? I want to find out just how much you
      really know about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter scratched one ear with a long hind foot and hesitated as if he
      didn't know just how to begin. Old Mother Nature waited patiently. Finally
      Peter began rather timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the only way I know how I look is by the way the
      other members of my family look, for I've never seen myself. I suppose in
      a way I look like all the rest of the Rabbit family. I have long hind legs
      and short front ones. I suppose this is so I can make long jumps when I am
      in a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded, and Peter, taking courage, continued. &ldquo;My hind
      legs are stout and strong, but my front ones are rather weak. I guess this
      is because I do not have a great deal of use for them, except for running.
      My coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray, more brown in summer and
      more gray in winter. My ears are longer for my size than are those of most
      animals, but really not very long after all, not nearly as long for my
      size as my cousin Jumper's are for his size. My tail doesn't amount to
      much because it is so short that it is hardly worth calling a tail. It is
      so short I carry it straight up. It is white like a little bunch of
      cotton, and I suppose that that is why I am called a Cottontail Rabbit,
      though I have heard that some folks call me a Gray Rabbit and others a
      Bush Rabbit. I guess I'm called Bush Rabbit because I like bushy country
      in which to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live in the dear Old Briar-patch and just love it. It is a mass of
      bushes and bramble-tangles and is the safest place I know of. I have cut
      little paths all through it just big enough for Mrs. Peter and myself.
      None of our enemies can get at us there, excepting Shadow the Weasel or
      Billy Mink. I have a sort of nest there where I spend my time when I am
      not running about. It is called a form and I sit in it a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In summer I eat clover, grass and other green things, and I just love to
      get over into Farmer Brown's garden. In winter I have to take what I can
      get, and this is mostly bark from young trees, buds and tender twigs of
      bushes, and any green plants I can find under the snow. I can run fast for
      a short distance, but only for a short distance. That is why I like thick
      brush and bramble-tangles. There I can dodge. I don't know any one who can
      beat me at dodging. If Reddy Fox or Bowser the Hound surprises me away
      from the dear Old Briar-patch I run for the nearest hollow log or hole in
      the ground. Sometimes in summer I dig a hole for myself, but not often. It
      is much easier to use a hole somebody else has dug. When I want to signal
      my friends I thump the ground with my hind feet. Jumper does the same
      thing. I forgot to say I don't like water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;You are thinking of that cousin of yours, the
      Marsh Rabbit who lives way down in the Sunny South,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked a wee bit foolish and admitted that he was. Jumper the Hare
      was all interest at once. You see, he had never heard of this cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a very good account of yourself, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;Now take a look at your cousin, Jumper the Hare, and tell me how he
      differs from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter took a long look at Jumper, and then, as before, scratched one ear
      with a long hind foot. &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Jumper is
      considerably bigger than I. He has very long hind legs and his ears are
      very long. In summer he wears a brown coat, but in winter he is all white
      but the tips of those long ears, and those are black. Because his coat
      changes so, he is called the varying Hare. He likes the Green Forest where
      the trees grow close together, especially those places where there are a
      great many young trees. He's the biggest member of our family. I guess
      that's all I know about Cousin Jumper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very good, Peter, as far as it goes,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;You have made only one mistake. Jumper is not the biggest of his family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both Peter and Jumper opened their eyes very wide with surprise. &ldquo;Also,&rdquo;
       continued Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;you forgot to mention the fact that Jumper
      never hides in hollow logs and holes in the ground as you do. Why don't
      you, Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't feel safe there,&rdquo; replied Jumper rather timidly. &ldquo;I depend on
      my long legs for safety, and the way I can dodge around trees and bushes.
      I suppose Reddy Fox may be fast enough to catch me in the open, but he
      can't do it where I can dodge around trees and bushes. That is why I stick
      to the Green Forest. If you please, Mother Nature, what is this about a
      cousin who likes to swim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled. &ldquo;We'll get to that later on,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;Now, each of you hold up a hind foot and tell me what difference you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Jumper each held up a hind foot and each looked first at his own
      and then at the other's. &ldquo;They look to me very much alike, only Jumper's
      is a lot longer and bigger than mine,&rdquo; said Peter. Jumper nodded as if he
      agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with your eyes?&rdquo; demanded Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Don't you
      see that Jumper's foot is a great deal broader than yours, Peter, and that
      his toes are spread apart, while yours are close together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Jumper looked sheepish, for it was just as Old Mother Nature had
      said. Jumper's foot really was quite different from that of Peter. Peter's
      was narrow and slim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very important difference,&rdquo; declared Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Can
      you guess why I gave you those big feet, Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jumper slowly shook his head. &ldquo;Not unless it was to make me different,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm surprised,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Yes, indeed, I'm surprised. You
      ought to know by this time that I never give anybody anything without a
      purpose. What happens to those big feet of yours in the winter, Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that I know of, excepting that the hair grows out long between my
      toes,&rdquo; Jumper replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; snapped Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;And when the hair does this you can
      travel over light snow without sinking in. It is just as if you had
      snowshoes. That is why you are often called a Snowshoe Rabbit. I gave you
      those big feet and make the hair grow out every winter because I know that
      you depend on your legs to get away from your enemies. You can run over
      the deep snow where your enemies break through. Peter, though he is small
      and lighter than you are, cannot go where you can. But Peter doesn't need
      to depend always on his legs to save his life. There is one thing more
      that I want you both to notice, and that is that you both have quite a lot
      of short hairs on the soles of you feet. That is where you differ from
      that cousin of yours down in the Sunny South. He has only a very few hairs
      on his feet. That is so he can swim better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Mother Nature, why is that cousin of ours so fond of the
      water?&rdquo; piped up Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;he lives in marshy country where
      there is a great deal of water. He is very nearly the same size as you,
      Peter, and looks very much like you. But his legs are not quite so long,
      his ears are a little smaller, and his tail is brownish instead of white.
      He is a poor runner and so in time of danger he takes to the water. For
      that matter, he goes swimming for pleasure. The water is warm down there,
      and he dearly loves to paddle about in it. If a Fox chases him he simply
      plunges into the water and hides among the water plants with only his eyes
      and his nose out of water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he make his home in the water like Jerry Muskrat?&rdquo; asked Peter
      innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Nature smiled and shook her head. &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;His home is on the ground. His babies are born in a nest made just as
      Mrs. Peter makes her nest for your babies, and Mrs. Jumper makes a nest
      for Jumper's babies. It is made of grass and lined with soft fur which
      Mrs. Rabbit pulls from her own breast, and it is very carefully hidden. By
      the way, Peter how do your babies differ from the babies of your Cousin
      Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My babies don't have their
      eyes open when they are born, and they haven't any hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jumper pricked up his long ears. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why, my babies
      have their eyes open and have the dearest little fur coats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature chuckled. &ldquo;That is the difference,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I guess
      both of you have learned something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said a little while ago that Jumper isn't the biggest of our family,&rdquo;
       said Peter. &ldquo;If you please, who is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are several bigger than Jumper,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, and
      smiled as she saw the funny look of surprise on the faces of Peter and
      Jumper. &ldquo;There is one way up the Frozen North and there are two cousins
      way out in the Great West. They are as much bigger than Jumper as Jumper
      is bigger than you, Peter. But I haven't time to tell you about them now.
      If you really want to learn about them, be here promptly at sun-up
      to-morrow morning. Hello! Here comes Reddy Fox, and he looks to me as if a
      good breakfast would not come amiss. Let me see what you have learned
      about taking care of yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter and Jumper gave one startled look in the direction Mother Nature was
      pointing. Sure enough, there was Reddy Fox. Not far away was a hollow log.
      Peter wasted no time in getting to it. In fact, he left in such a hurry
      that he forgot to say good-by to Old Mother Nature. But she didn't mind,
      for she quite understood Peter's feelings, and she laughed when she saw
      his funny little white tail disappear inside the hollow log. As for
      Jumper, he promptly took to his long legs and disappeared with great
      bounds, Reddy Fox racing after him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III More of Peter's Long-Legged Cousins
    </h2>
    <p>
      At sun-up the next morning Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were on hand
      promptly for their next lesson. Old Mother Nature smiled as she saw the
      eager curiosity shining in their eyes. She didn't wait for them to ask
      questions. &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I told you about your water-loving
      cousin, the Marsh Rabbit. You have another relative down there in the
      Sunny South who is almost as fond of the water. Some folks call him the
      Swamp Rabbit. Others call him the Swamp Hare. The latter is really the
      best name for him, because he is a true Hare. He lives in swamps instead
      of marshes, but he is a splendid swimmer and fond of the water. When he is
      chased by an enemy he makes for the nearest point or stream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big is he?&rdquo; asked Jumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about your size, Jumper,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;If anything,
      he is a little bit heavier. But because his hair lies much smoother than
      yours, you probably would look a little bit bigger if you were sitting
      beside him. As with his cousin, the Marsh Rabbit, the hair on his feet is
      thin. His toes are rather long and he can spread them widely, which is a
      great help in swimming. He doesn't have to take to the water as his little
      cousin does, for he is a very good runner. But he does take to it as the
      easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him. The Marsh Rabbit
      and the Swamp Hare are the only members of your family in all the Great
      World who are fond of the water and who are at home in it. Now, who shall
      I tell you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our biggest cousins,&rdquo; cried Peter and Jumper together. &ldquo;The ones you told
      us yesterday are bigger than Jumper,&rdquo; added Peter. &ldquo;It is hard to believe
      that there can be any much bigger than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature's eyes twinkled. &ldquo;It is often hard to believe things you
      know nothing about,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Compared with these other relatives,
      Jumper really isn't big at all. He seems big to you, Peter, but if he
      should meet his cousin, Snow White the Arctic Hare, who lives way up in
      the Frozen North, I am quite sure Jumper would feel small. Snow White
      looks very much like Jumper in his winter coat, for he is all white save
      the tips of his ears, which are black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he wear a white coat all year round?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he lives so far north that there is snow and ice for most of the
      year, he does,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;But when he lives far enough
      south for the snow to disappear for a little while in the summer, he
      changes his white coat for one of gray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can he live so far north that the snow and ice seldom melt?&rdquo;
       asked Peter, looking very much puzzled. &ldquo;What can he find to eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even way up there there is moss growing under the snow. And in the short
      summer other plants grow. During the long winter Snow White digs down
      through the snow to get these. He also eats the bark and twigs of little
      stunted trees. But big as he is, you have a cousin who is still bigger,
      the biggest of all the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Jumper and Peter cried together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is called White-tailed Jack,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;And he lives
      chiefly on the great plains of the Northwest, though sometimes he is found
      in the mountains and forests. He is sometimes called the Prairie Hare. In
      winter his coat is white, but in summer it is a light brown. Summer or
      winter his tail is white, wherein he is much like you, Peter. It is
      because of this that he is called White-tailed Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his tail as short as mine?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed right out. &ldquo;No, Peter,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It
      wouldn't be called a long tail by any other animal, but for a member of
      your family it really is long, and when White-tailed Jack is running he
      switches it from side to side. His hind legs are very long and powerful,
      and he can make a single jump of twenty feet without half trying. Not even
      Old Man Coyote can catch him in a straightaway race. You think Jumper's
      ears are long, Peter, but they are short compared to the ears of
      White-tailed Jack. Not only are his ears long, but they are very big. When
      he squats in his form and lays his ears back they reach way over his
      shoulders. Like the other members of the Hare family he doesn't use holes
      in the ground or hollow logs. He trusts to his long legs and to his
      wonderful speed to escape from his enemies. Among the latter are Howler
      the Wolf, Old Man Coyote, Eagles, Hawks and Owls. He is so big that he
      would make five or six of you, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter drew a long breath. &ldquo;It is dreadfully hard to believe that I can
      have a cousin as big as that,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;But of course if you say it
      is so, it is so,&rdquo; he hastened to add. &ldquo;Have I any other cousins anywhere
      near as big?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;There are some others very like White-tailed
      Jack, only not quite as big,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;They have just such long hind
      legs, and just such great ears, but their coats are different, and they
      live on the great plains farther south. Some of them live so far south
      that it is warm all the year round. One of these latter is Antelope Jack,
      whose home is in the Southwest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about him,&rdquo; begged Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;he is a member of the big
      Jack Rabbit or Jack Hare branch of your family. None of this branch should
      be called a Rabbit. All the members are first cousins to Jumper and are
      true Hares. All have big ears, long, rather thin necks, and long legs.
      Even their front legs are comparatively long. Antelope Jack is probably
      next in size to White-tailed Jack. Strange to say, although he lives where
      it is warm for most of the year, his coat is very largely white. His back
      is a yellowish-brown and so is his throat. But his sides are white. The
      surprising thing about him is that he has the power of making himself seem
      almost wholly white. He can make the white hair spread out at will by
      means of some special little muscles which I have given him, so that the
      white of his sides at times almost seems to meet on his back. When he does
      this in the sun it makes flashes of white which can be seen a long way. By
      means of this Antelope Jack and his friends can keep track of each other
      when they are a long distance apart. There is only one other animal who
      can flash signals in this way, and that is the Antelope of whom I will
      tell you some other time. It is because Jack flashes signals in this way
      that he is called Antelope Jack. In his habits he is otherwise much like
      the other members of his family. He trusts to his long legs and his
      wonderful powers of jumping to keep him out of danger. He is not as well
      known as his commoner cousin, plain Jack Rabbit. Everybody knows Jack
      Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; said he very meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it is time you did,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;If you had ever
      been in the Far West you would know him. Everybody out there knows him. He
      isn't quite as big as Antelope Jack but still he is a big fellow. He wears
      a brownish coat much like Jumper's, and the tips of his long ears are
      black. His tail is longer than Jumper's, and when he runs he carries it
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't carry mine down,&rdquo; Peter piped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed right out. &ldquo;True enough, Peter, true enough,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;You couldn't if you wanted to. It isn't long enough to carry
      any way but up. Jack has more of a tail than you have, just as he has
      longer legs. My, how he can run! He goes with great bounds and about every
      tenth bound he jumps very high. This is so that he can get a good look
      around to watch out for enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are his enemies?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foxes, Coyotes, Hawks, Eagles, Owls, Weasels, and men,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;In fact, he has about as many enemies as you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose when you say men, you mean hunters,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I mean those who hunt him for
      fun and those who hunt him to get rid of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter pricked up his ears. &ldquo;What do they want to get rid of him for. What
      harm does he do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he lives far away from the homes of men he does no harm,&rdquo; replied
      Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;But when he lives near the homes of men he gets into
      mischief, just as you do when you visit Farmer Brown's garden.&rdquo; Old Mother
      Nature looked very severe when she said this and Peter hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I ought to keep away from that garden,&rdquo; said Peter very meekly,
      &ldquo;but you have no idea what a temptation it is. The things in that garden
      do taste so good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature turned her head to hide the twinkle in her eyes. When
      she turned toward Peter again her face was severe as before. &ldquo;That is no
      excuse, Peter Rabbit,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You should be sufficiently strong-minded
      not to yield to temptation. Yielding to temptation is the cause of most of
      the trouble in this world. It has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit. Jack
      just cannot keep away from the crops planted by men. His family is very
      large, and when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young
      wheat, or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and
      sweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed for
      becoming angry and seeking to kill them. Yes, I am sorry to say, Jack
      Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where he has no business.
      Now I guess you have learned sufficient about your long-legged cousins.
      I've a great deal to do, so skip along home, both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Mother Nature, may we come again to-morrow?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Haven't you learned enough about
      your family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;but there are lots and lots of things I would like
      to know about other people. If you please, I would like to come to school
      to you every day. You see, the more I learn about my neighbors, the better
      able I will be to take care of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Curiosity,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly,
      &ldquo;come again to-morrow morning. I wouldn't for the world deny any one who
      is really seeking for knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter and Jumper politely bade her good-by and started for their homes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV Chatterer and Happy Jack Join
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit, on his way to school to Old Mother Nature, was trying to
      make up his mind about which of his neighbors he would ask. He had learned
      so many surprising things about his own family that he shrewdly suspected
      many equally surprising things were to be learned about his neighbors. But
      there were so many neighbors he couldn't decide which one to ask about
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that matter was settled for him, and in a funny way. Hardly had he
      reached the edge of the Green Forest when he was hailed by a sharp voice.
      &ldquo;Hello, Peter Rabbit!&rdquo; said this sharp voice. &ldquo;Where are you bound at this
      hour of the morning? You ought to be heading for home in the dear Old
      Briar-patch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter knew that voice the instant he heard it. It was the voice of Happy
      Jack the Gray Squirrel. Happy Jack was seated on the top of an old stump,
      eating a nut. &ldquo;I'm going to school,&rdquo; replied Peter with a great deal of
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to school! Ho, ho, ho! Going to school!&rdquo; exclaimed Happy Jack.
      &ldquo;Pray tell me to whom you are going to school, and what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to school to Old Mother Nature,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;I've been
      going for several days, and so has my cousin, Jumper the Hare. We've
      learned a lot about our own family and now we are going to learn about the
      other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Happy Jack. &ldquo;Pooh! I know all about my own family, and I
      guess there isn't much worth knowing about my neighbors that I don't
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so, Mr. Know-it-all,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;I don't believe you even
      know all your own cousins. I thought I knew all mine, but I found I
      didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you fellows talking about?&rdquo; asked another voice, a sharp
      scolding voice, and Chatterer the Red Squirrel jumped from one tree to
      another just above Peter's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter is trying to make me believe that I don't know as much as I might
      about our own family,&rdquo; snapped Happy Jack indignantly. &ldquo;He is on his way
      to school to Old Mother Nature and has advised me to join him. Isn't that
      a joke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it is, and maybe it isn't,&rdquo; retorted Chatterer, who isn't the best
      of friends with his cousin, Happy Jack. &ldquo;If I don't know as much about the
      Squirrel family as you do, may I never find another nut as long as I live.
      But at that, I'm not sure I know all there is to know. I think it would be
      fun to go to school for a while. What do you say, Peter, if I go along
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter said that he thought it would be a very fine thing and that
      Chatterer never would regret it. Chatterer winked at his cousin, Happy
      Jack, and followed Peter, only of course, Chatterer kept in the trees
      while Peter was on the ground. Happy Jack hesitated a minute and then,
      curiosity becoming too much for him, he hastened after the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Old Mother Nature, as Happy Jack and Chatterer appeared
      with Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;What are you frisky folks doing over here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack and Chatterer appeared to have lost their tongues, something
      very unusual for them, especially for Chatterer. The fact is, in the
      presence of Old Mother Nature they felt bashful. Peter replied for them.
      &ldquo;They've decided to come to school, too,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Happy Jack says he
      knows all about his own family, but he has come along to find out if he
      really does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't take us long to find out,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature softly and her
      eyes twinkled with amusement. &ldquo;How many cousins have you, Happy Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack thought for a moment. &ldquo;Three,&rdquo; he replied, but he didn't say it
      in a very positive way. Peter chuckled to himself, for he knew that
      already doubt was beginning to grow in Happy Jack's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them,&rdquo; commanded Old Mother Nature promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatterer the Red Squirrel, Timmy the Flying Squirrel, and Striped
      Chipmunk,&rdquo; replied Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's forgotten Rusty the Fox Squirrel,&rdquo; shouted Chatterer, dancing about
      gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack looked crestfallen and gave Chatterer an angry look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Chatterer,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Rusty is a very
      important member of the Squirrel family. Now suppose you name the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what others?&rdquo; stammered Chatterer. &ldquo;I don't know of
      any others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit hugged himself with glee as he watched the faces of Happy
      Jack and Chatterer. &ldquo;They don't know any more about their family than we
      did about ours,&rdquo; he whispered in one of the long ears of Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Old Mother Nature, she smiled indulgently. &ldquo;Put on your
      thinking-caps, you two,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You haven't named half of them. You
      are not wholly to blame for that, for some of them you never have seen,
      but there is one member of the Squirrel family whom both of you know very
      well, yet whom neither of you named. Put on your thinking-caps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer looked at Happy Jack, and Happy Jack looked at Chatterer, and
      each scratched his head. Each wanted to be the first to think of that
      other cousin, for each was jealous of the other. But though they scratched
      and scratched their heads, they couldn't think who that other cousin could
      be. Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes before she told them. Then,
      seeing that either they couldn't remember or didn't know, she said, &ldquo;You
      didn't mention Johnny Chuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny Chuck!&rdquo; exclaimed Chatterer and Happy Jack together, and the look
      of surprise on their faces was funny to see. For that matter, the looks on
      the faces of Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare were equally funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;Johnny Chuck,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;He is a member of
      the Squirrel family. He belongs to the Marmot branch, but he is a Squirrel
      just the same. He is one of your cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a mighty funny looking Squirrel,&rdquo; said Chatterer, jerking his tail
      as only he can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That just shows your ignorance, Chatterer,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature
      rather sharply. &ldquo;I'm surprised at the ignorance of you two.&rdquo; She looked
      first at Chatterer, than at Happy Jack. &ldquo;It is high time you came to
      school to me for a while. You've got a lot to learn. For that matter, so
      have Peter and Jumper. Now which of you can tell me what order you all
      belong to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack looked at Chatterer, Chatterer looked at Peter Rabbit, and
      Peter looked at Jumper the Hare. On the face of each was such a funny,
      puzzled expression that Old Mother Nature almost laughed right out.
      Finally Peter Rabbit found his tongue. &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I guess
      we don't know what you mean by an order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;I thought as much. In the
      first place, the animals of the Great World are divided into big groups or
      divisions, and then these groups are divided into smaller groups, and
      these in turn into still smaller groups. Happy Jack and Chatterer belong
      to a group called the Squirrel family, and Peter and Jumper to a group
      called the Hare family. Both of these families and several other families
      belong to a bigger group called an order, and this order is the order of
      Gnawers, or Rodents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit fairly jumped up in the air, he was so excited. &ldquo;Then Jumper
      and I must be related to Happy Jack and Chatterer,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way you are,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;It isn't a very close
      relationship, still you are related. All of you are Rodents. So are all
      the members of the Rat and Mouse family, the Beaver family, the Porcupine
      family, the Pocket Gopher family, the Pika family, and the Sewellel
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Peter's eyes looked as if they would pop right out of his
      head. &ldquo;This is the first time I've ever heard of some of those families,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;My, what a lot we have to learn! Is it because all the members
      of all those families have teeth for gnawing that they are all sort of
      related?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature looked pleased. &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I think you ought to
      go to the head of the class. That is just why. All the members of all the
      families I have named belong to the same order, the order of Rodents. All
      the members have big, cutting, front teeth. Animals without such teeth
      cannot gnaw. Now, as you and Jumper have learned about your family, it is
      the turn of Happy Jack and Chatterer to learn about their family. Theirs
      is rather a large family, and it is divided into three groups, the first
      of which consists of the true Squirrels, to which group both Happy Jack
      and Chatterer belong. The second group consists of the Marmots, and Johnny
      Chuck belongs to this. The third group Timmy the Flying Squirrel has all
      to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Striped Chipmunk come in?&rdquo; asked Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm coming to that,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;The true Squirrels are
      divided into the Tree Squirrels, Rock Squirrels, and Ground Squirrels. Of
      course Chatterer and Happy Jack are Tree Squirrels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Striped Chipmunk is a Ground Squirrel,&rdquo; interrupted Peter, looking as
      if he felt very much pleased with his own smartness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;You are wrong this time, Peter,&rdquo; said
      she, and Peter looked as foolish as he felt. &ldquo;Striped Chipmunk is a Rock
      Squirrel. Seek Seek the Spermophile who lives on the plains of the West
      and is often called Gopher Squirrel, is the true Ground Squirrel. Now I
      can't spend any more time with you little folks this morning, because I've
      too much to do. To-morrow morning I shall expect Chatterer to tell me all
      about Happy Jack, and Happy Jack to tell me all about Chatterer. Now
      scamper along, all of you, and think over what you have learned this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter and Jumper and Chatterer and Happy Jack thanked Old Mother Nature
      for what she had told them and scampered away. Peter headed straight for
      the far corner of the Old Orchard where he was sure he would find Johnny
      Chuck. He couldn't get there fast enough, for he wanted to be the first to
      tell Johnny Chuck that he was a Squirrel. You see he didn't believe that
      Johnny knew it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V The Squirrels of the Trees
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit found Johnny Chuck sitting on his doorstep, sunning himself.
      Peter was quite out of breath because he had hurried so. &ldquo;Do you know that
      you are a Squirrel, Johnny Chuck?&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny slowly turned his head and looked at Peter as if he thought Peter
      had suddenly gone crazy. &ldquo;What are you talking about, Peter Rabbit? I'm
      not a Squirrel; I'm a Woodchuck,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same, you are a Squirrel,&rdquo; retorted Peter. &ldquo;The Woodchucks
      belong to the Squirrel family. Old Mother Nature says so, and if she says
      so, it is so. You'd better join our school, Johnny Chuck, and learn a
      little about your own relatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck blinked his eyes and for a minute or two couldn't find a word
      to say. He knew that if Peter were telling the truth as to what Old Mother
      Nature had said, it must be true that he was member of the Squirrel
      family. But it was hard to believe. &ldquo;What is this school?&rdquo; he finally
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hastened to tell him. He told Johnny all about what he and Jumper
      the Hare had learned about their family, and all the surprising things Old
      Mother Nature had told them about the Squirrel family, and he ended by
      again urging Johnny Chuck to join the school and promised to call for
      Johnny the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Johnny Chuck is lazy and does not like to go far from his own
      doorstep, so when Peter called the next morning Johnny refused to go,
      despite all Peter could say. Peter didn't waste much time arguing for he
      was afraid he would be late and miss something. When he reached the Green
      Forest he found his cousin, Jumper the Hare, and Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel, and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, already there. As soon as
      Peter arrived Old Mother Nature began the morning lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy Jack,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you may tell us all you know about your cousin,
      Chatterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with, he is the smallest of the Tree Squirrels,&rdquo; said Happy
      Jack. &ldquo;He isn't so very much bigger than Striped Chipmunk, and that means
      that he is less than half as big as myself. His coat is red and his
      waistcoat white; his tail is about two-thirds as long as his body and flat
      but not very broad. Personally, I don't think it is much of a tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once Chatterer's quick temper flared up and he began to scold. But Old
      Mother Nature silenced him and told Happy Jack to go on. &ldquo;He spends more
      of his time in the trees than I do,&rdquo; continued Happy Jack, &ldquo;and is
      especially fond of pine trees and other cone-bearing trees. He likes the
      deeper parts of the Green Forest better than I do, though he seems to feel
      just as much at home on the edge of the Green Forest, especially if it is
      near a farm where he can steal corn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer started to scold again but was silenced once more by Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;I have to admit that Chatterer is thrifty,&rdquo; continued Happy Jack,
      quite as if he hadn't been interrupted. &ldquo;He is very fond of the seeds of
      cone-bearing trees. He cuts the cones from the trees just before they are
      ripe. Then they ripen and open on the ground, where he can get at the
      seeds easily. He often has a number of store-houses and stores up cone
      seeds, acorns, nuts, and corn when he can get it. He builds a nest of
      leaves and strips of bark, sometimes in a hollow tree and sometimes high
      up in the branches of an evergreen tree. He is a good jumper and jumps
      from tree to tree. He is a busybody and always poking his nose in where he
      has no business. He steals my stores whenever he can find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do the same thing to me when you have the chance, which isn't often,&rdquo;
       sputtered Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack turned his back to Chatterer and continued, &ldquo;He doesn't seem to
      mind cold weather at all, as long as the sun shines. His noisy tongue is
      to be heard on the coldest days of winter. He is the sauciest, most
      impudent fellow of the Green Forest, and never so happy as when he is
      making trouble for others. He sauces and scolds everybody he meets, and
      every time he opens his mouth he jerks his tail. He's quarrelsome. Worse
      than that, in the spring when the birds are nesting, he turns robber. He
      goes hunting for nests and steals the eggs, and what is even more
      dreadful, he kills and eats the baby birds. All the birds hate him, and I
      don't blame them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer could contain himself no longer. His tongue fairly flew and he
      jerked his tail so hard and so fast that Peter Rabbit almost expected to
      see him break it right off. He called Happy Jack names, all the bad names
      he could think of, and worked himself up into such a rage that it was some
      time before Old Mother Nature could quiet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he stopped from sheer lack of breath, Old Mother Nature
      spoke, and her voice was very severe. &ldquo;I'm ashamed of you, Chatterer,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;Unfortunately, what Happy Jack has said about you is true. In
      many ways you are a disgrace to the Green Forest. Still I don't know how
      the Green Forest could get along without you. Happy Jack forgot to mention
      that you eat some insects at times. He also forgot to mention that
      sometimes you have a storehouse down in the ground. Now tell us what you
      know about your cousin, Happy Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes Chatterer sulked, but he did not dare disobey Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;I don't know much good about him,&rdquo; he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't know much bad about me either,&rdquo; retorted Happy Jack
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature held up a warning hand. &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now,
      Chatterer, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy Jack is more than twice as big as I, but at that, I'm not afraid of
      him,&rdquo; said Chatterer and glared at Happy Jack. &ldquo;He is gray all over,
      except underneath, where he is white. He has a tremendously big tail and
      is so proud of it he shows it off whenever he has a chance. When he sits
      up he has a way of folding his hands on his breast. I don't know what he
      does it for unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather. He builds a
      nest very much like mine. Sometimes it is in a hollow tree, but quite as
      often it is in the branches of a tree. He is a good traveler in the
      tree-tops, but he spends a good deal of his time on the ground. He likes
      open woodland best, especially where there are many nut trees. He has a
      storehouse where he stores up nuts for winter, but he buries in the ground
      and under the leaves more than he puts in his storehouse. In winter, when
      he is hungry, he hunts for those buried nuts, and somehow he manages to
      find them even when they are covered with snow. When he comes to stealing
      he is not better than I am. I have seen him steal birds' eggs, and I
      wouldn't trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Happy Jacks' turn to become indignant. &ldquo;I may have taken a few eggs
      when I accidentally ran across them,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I never go looking for
      them, and I don't take them unless I am very hungry and can't find
      anything else. I don't make a business of robbing birds the way you do,
      and you know it. If I find one of your storehouses and help myself, I am
      only getting back what you have stolen from me. Everybody loves me and
      that is more than you can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough,&rdquo; declared Old Mother Nature, and her voice was very sharp.
      &ldquo;You two cousins never have agreed and I am afraid never will. As long as
      you are neighbors, I suspect you will quarrel. Have you told us all you
      know about Happy Jack, Chatterer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer nodded. He was still mumbling to himself angrily and wasn't
      polite enough to make a reply. Old Mother Nature took no notice of this.
      &ldquo;What you have told us is good as far as it goes,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You said
      that Happy Jack is all gray excepting underneath. Usually the Gray
      Squirrel is just as Chatterer has described him, but sometimes a Gray
      Squirrel isn't gray at all, but all black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit's ears stood straight up with astonishment. &ldquo;How can a Gray
      Squirrel be black?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;That is a fair question, Peter,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;Gray Squirrel is simply the name of Happy Jack's family. Sometimes some
      of the babies are born with black coats instead of gray coats. Of course
      they are just the same kind of Squirrel, only they look different. In some
      parts of the country there are numbers of these black-coated Squirrels and
      many think they are a different kind of Squirrel. They are not. They are
      simply black-coated members of Happy Jack's family. Just remember this. It
      is the same way in the family of Rusty the Fox Squirrel. Some members are
      rusty red, some are a mixture of red and gray, and some are as gray as
      Happy Jack himself. Way down in the Sunny South Fox Squirrels always have
      white noses and ears. In the North they never have white noses and ears.
      Rusty the Fox Squirrel is just a little bigger than Happy Jack and has
      just such a handsome tail. He is the strongest and heaviest of the Tree
      Squirrels and not nearly as quick and graceful as Happy Jack. Sometimes
      Rusty has two nests in the same tree, one in a hollow in a tree for bad
      weather and the other made of sticks and leaves outside in the branches
      for use in good weather. Rusty's habits are very much the same as those of
      Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, and therefore he likes the same kind of
      surroundings. Like his cousin, Happy Jack, Rusty is a great help to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing how surprised everybody looked, Mother Nature explained. &ldquo;Both
      Happy Jack and Rusty bury a great many more nuts than they ever need,&rdquo;
       said she, &ldquo;and those they do not dig up sprout in the spring and grow. In
      that way they plant ever so many trees without knowing it. Just remember
      that, Chatterer, the next time you are tempted to quarrel with your
      cousin, Happy Jack. Very likely Happy Jack's great-great-ever-so-great
      grandfather planted the very tree you get your fattest and best hickory
      nuts from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way out in the mountains of the Far West you have a cousin called the
      Douglas Squirrel, who is really a true Red Squirrel and whose habits are
      very much like your own. Some folks call him the Pine Squirrel. By the
      way, Chatterer, Happy Jack forgot to say that you are a good swimmer.
      Perhaps he didn't know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the expression of Happy Jack's face it was quite clear that he didn't
      know it. &ldquo;Certainly I can swim,&rdquo; said Chatterer. &ldquo;I don't mind the water
      at all. I can swim a long distance if I have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was quite as much news to Peter Rabbit as had been the fact that a
      cousin of his own was a good swimmer, and he began to feel something very
      like respect for Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any other Tree Squirrels?&rdquo; asked Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;there are two&mdash;the handsomest of
      all the family. They live out in the Southwest, in one of the most
      wonderful places in all this great land, a place called the Grand Canyon.
      One is called the Abert Squirrel and the other the Kaibab Squirrel. They
      are about the size of Happy Jack and Rusty but have broader, handsomer
      tails and their ears have long tufts of hair. The Abert Squirrel has black
      ears, a brown back, gray sides and white underneath. Kaibab has brown ears
      with black tips, and his tail is mostly white. Both are very lovely, but
      their families are small and so they are little known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this, Old Mother Nature dismissed school for the day.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI Striped Chipmunk and his Cousins
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of course there couldn't be a school in the Green Forest without news of
      it spreading very fast. News travels quickly through the Green Forest and
      over the Green Meadows, for the little people who live there are great
      gossips. So it was not surprising that Striped Chipmunk heard all about
      Old Mother Nature's school. The next morning, just as the daily lesson was
      beginning, Striped Chipmunk came hurrying up, quite our of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! See who's here!&rdquo; exclaimed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;What have you
      come for, Striped Chipmunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to try to learn. Will you let me stay, Mother Nature?&rdquo; replied
      Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'll let you stay,&rdquo; cried Old Mother Nature heartily. &ldquo;I am
      glad you have come, especially glad you have come today, because to-day's
      lesson is to be about you and your cousins. Now, Peter Rabbit, what are
      the differences between Striped Chipmunk and his cousins, the Tree
      Squirrels?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked very hard at Striped Chipmunk as if he had never really seen
      him before. &ldquo;He is smaller than they are,&rdquo; began Peter. &ldquo;In fact, he is
      the smallest Squirrel I know.&rdquo; Peter paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded encouragingly. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wears a striped coat,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;The stripes are black and
      yellowish-white and run along his sides, a black stripe running down the
      middle of his back. The rest of his coat is reddish-brown above and light
      underneath. His tail is rather thin and flat. I never see him in the
      trees, so I guess he can't climb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can,&rdquo; interrupted Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;I can climb if I want to,
      and I do sometimes, but prefer the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to like old stone walls and rock piles,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;and
      he is one of the brightest, liveliest, merriest and the most lovable of
      all my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Peter,&rdquo; said Striped Chipmunk softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have been able to find his home,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;That is one
      of his secrets. But I know it is in the ground. I guess this is all I know
      about him. I should say the chief difference between Striped Chipmunk and
      the Tree Squirrels is that he spends all his time on the ground while the
      others live largely in the trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;But there are two very
      important differences which you have not mentioned. Striped Chipmunk has a
      big pocket on the inside of each cheek, while his cousins of the trees
      have no pockets at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;I don't see how I came to forget that. I've
      laughed many times at Striped Chipmunk with those pockets stuffed with
      nuts or seeds until his head looked three times bigger than it does now.
      Those pockets must be very handy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;I couldn't get along without them.
      They save me a lot of running back and forth, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the other great difference,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;is that Striped
      Chipmunk sleeps nearly all winter, just waking up occasionally to pop his
      head out on a bright day to see how the weather is. A great many folks
      call Striped Chipmunk a Ground Squirrel, but more properly he is a Rock
      Squirrel because he likes stony places best. Supposing, Striped Chipmunk,
      you tell us where and how you make your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make my home down in the ground,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;I dig a
      tunnel just big enough to run along comfortably. Down deep enough to be
      out of reach of Jack Frost I make a nice little bedroom with a bed of
      grass and leaves, and I make another little room for a storeroom in which
      to keep my supply of seeds and nuts. Sometimes I have more than one
      storeroom. Also I have some little side tunnels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is it I never have been able to find the entrance to your
      tunnel?&rdquo; asked Peter, as full of curiosity as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have it hidden underneath the stone wall on the edge of the Old
      Orchard,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even then, I should think that all the sand you must have taken out
      would give your secret away,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Striped Chipmunk chuckled happily. It was a throaty little chuckle,
      pleasant to hear. &ldquo;I looked out for that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There isn't a grain
      of that sand around my doorway. I took it all out through another hole
      some distance away, a sort of back door, and then closed it up solidly. If
      you please, Mother Nature, if I am not a Ground Squirrel, who is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin, Seek Seek the Spermophile, sometimes called Gopher Squirrel,
      who lives on the open plains of the West where there are no rocks or
      stones. He likes best the flat, open country. He is called Spermophile
      because that means seed-eater, and he lives largely on seeds, especially
      on grain. Because of this he does a great deal of damage and is much
      disliked by farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seek Seek's family are the true Ground Squirrels. Please remember that
      they never should be called Gophers, for they are not Gophers. One of the
      smallest members of the family is just about your size, Striped Chipmunk,
      and he also wears stripes, only he has more of them than you have, and
      they are broken up into little dots. He is called the Thirteen-lined
      Spermophile. He has pockets in his cheeks just as you have, and he makes a
      home down in the ground very similar to yours. All the family do this, and
      all of them sleep through the winter. While they are great seed-eaters
      they also eat a great many insects and worms, and some of them even are
      guilty of killing and eating the babies of birds that nest on the ground,
      and also young mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some members of the family are almost as big as Happy Jack the Gray
      Squirrel and have gray coats. They are called Gray Ground Squirrels and
      sometimes Gray Gophers. One of the largest of these is the California
      Ground Squirrel. He has a big, bushy tail, very like Happy Jack's. He gets
      into so much mischief in the grain fields and in the orchards that he is
      quite as much disliked as is Jack Rabbit. This particular member of the
      family is quite as much at home among rocks and tree roots as in open
      ground. He climbs low trees for fruit and nuts, but prefers to stay on the
      ground. Now just remember that the Chipmunks are Rock Squirrels and their
      cousins the Spermophiles are Ground Squirrels. Now who of you has seen
      Timmy the Flying Squirrel lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; said Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; said Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; said Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; spoke up Jumper the Hare. &ldquo;I saw him last evening just after
      jolly, round, red Mr. Sun went to bed behind the Purple Hills and the
      Black Shadows came creeping through the Green Forest. My, I wish I could
      fly the way he can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head disapprovingly. &ldquo;Jumper,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what
      is wrong with your eyes? When did you ever see Timmy fly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; insisted Jumper stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you didn't,&rdquo; retorted Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You didn't see him fly,
      for the very good reason that he cannot fly any more than you can. You saw
      him simply jump. Just remember that the only animals in this great land
      who can fly are the Bats. Timmy the Flying Squirrel simply jumps from the
      top of a tree and slides down on the air to the foot of another tree. If
      you had used your eyes you would have noticed that when he is in the air
      he never moves his legs or arms, and he is always coming down, never going
      up, excepting for a little at the end of his jump, as would be the case if
      he could really fly. He hasn't any wings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he's flying, I mean jumping, he looks as if he had wings,&rdquo; insisted
      Jumper stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is simply because I have given him a fold of skin between the front
      and hind leg on each side,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;When he jumps he
      stretches his legs out flat, and that stretches out those two folds of
      skin until they look almost like wings. This is the reason he can sail so
      far when he jumps from a high place. You've seen a bird, after flapping
      its wings to get going, sail along with them outstretched and motionless.
      Timmy does the same thing, only he gets going by jumping. You may have
      noticed that he usually goes to the top of a tree before jumping; then he
      can sail down a wonderfully long distance. His tail helps him to keep his
      balance. If there is anything in the way, he can steer himself around it.
      When he reaches the tree he is jumping for he shoots up a little way and
      lands on the trunk not far above the ground. Then he scampers up that tree
      to do it all over again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why don't we ever see him?&rdquo; inquired Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, when the rest of you squirrels are out and about, he is curled
      up in a little ball in his nest, fast asleep. Timmy likes the night,
      especially the early evening, and doesn't like the light of day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big is he?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack, and looked a little sheepish as if he
      were a wee bit ashamed of not being acquainted with one of his own
      cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, if anything, a little smaller than Striped Chipmunk,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;Way out in the Far West he grows a little bigger. His coat
      is a soft yellowish-brown above; beneath he is all white. His fur is
      wonderfully soft. He has very large, dark, soft eyes, especially suited
      for seeing at night. Then, he is very lively and dearly loves to play. By
      nature he is gentle and lovable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he eat nuts like his cousins?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly does,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Also he eats grubs and
      insects. He dearly loves a fat beetle. He likes meat when he can get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he make his home?&rdquo; Peter inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually in a hole in a tree,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is very fond of
      an old home of a Woodpecker. He makes a comfortable nest of bark lining,
      grass, and moss, or any other soft material he can find. Occasionally he
      builds an outside nest high up in a fork in the branches of a tree. He
      likes to get into old buildings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he have many enemies?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same enemies the rest of you have,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;But
      the one he has most reason to fear is Hooty the Owl, and that is the one
      you have least reason to fear, because Hooty seldom hunts by day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he sleep all winter?&rdquo; piped up Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as you do,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;In very cold weather he sleeps,
      but if he happens to be living where the weather does not get very cold,
      he is active all the year around. Now I guess this is enough about the
      Squirrel family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've forgotten Johnny Chuck,&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;So I have,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;That will never do,
      never in the world. Johnny and his relatives, the Marmots, certainly
      cannot be overlooked. We will take them for our lesson to-morrow. Peter,
      you tell Johnny Chuck to come over here to-morrow morning.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII Johnny Chuck Joins the Class
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit delivered Mother Nature's message to Johnny Chuck. Johnny
      didn't seem at all pleased. He grumbled and growled to himself. He didn't
      want to go to school. He didn't want to learn anything about his
      relatives. He was perfectly satisfied with things as they were. The truth
      is, Johnny Chuck was already beginning to get fat with good living and he
      is naturally lazy. As a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home,
      so he seldom goes far from his own doorstep. Peter left him grumbling and
      growling, and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear Old
      Briar-patch. He knew that Johnny Chuck would not dare disobey Old Mother
      Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, the next morning Johnny Chuck came waddling through the Green
      Forest just as Old Mother Nature was about to open school. He didn't look
      at all happy, and he didn't reply at all to the greetings of the others.
      But when Old Mother Nature spoke to him he was very polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Johnny Chuck,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny bobbed his head and said, &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; continued Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;That you are not at all
      interested in learning about your relatives. I am sorry for any one who
      doesn't want to learn. The more one knows the better fitted he is to take
      care of himself and do his part in the work of the Great World. However,
      it wasn't for your benefit that I sent word for you to be here this
      morning. It was for the benefit of your friends and neighbors. Now sit up
      so that all can get a good look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck obediently sat up, and of course all the others stared at
      him. It made him feel quite uncomfortable. &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature, &ldquo;how surprised you little folks were when I told you that Johnny
      Chuck is a member of the Squirrel family. Happy Jack, you go sit beside
      Johnny Chuck, and the rest of you look hard at Happy Jack and Johnny and
      see if you do not see a family resemblance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Happy Jack and Johnny Chuck sitting up side by side, Peter Rabbit
      caught the resemblance at once. There was sort of family look about them.
      &ldquo;Why! Why-ee! Johnny Chuck does look like a Squirrel,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he looks like a Squirrel, because he is one,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;Johnny Chuck is very much bigger and so stout in the body that he
      has none of the gracefulness of the true Squirrels. But you will notice
      that the shape of his head is much the same as that of Happy Jack. He has
      a Squirrel face when you come to look at him closely. The Woodchucks,
      sometimes called Ground Hogs, though why any one should call them this is
      more than I can understand, belong to the Marmot branch of the Squirrel
      family, and wherever found they look much alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you will notice, Johnny Chuck's coat is brownish-yellow, his feet are
      very dark brown, almost black. His head is dark brown with light gray on
      his cheeks. Beneath he is reddish-orange, including his throat. His tail
      is short for a member of the Squirrel family, and although it is bushy, it
      is not very big. He has a number of whiskers and they are black. Some
      Woodchucks are quite gray, and occasionally there is one who is almost, or
      wholly black, just as there are black Gray Squirrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny, here, is not fond of the Green Forest, but loves the Old orchard
      and the Green Meadows. In some parts of the country there are members of
      his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the Green Forest. You
      will notice that Johnny has stout claws. Those are to help him dig, for
      all the Marmot family are great diggers. What other use do you have for
      those claws, Johnny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They help me to climb,&rdquo; replied Johnny promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;Who ever heard of a Woodchuck climbing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can climb if I have to,&rdquo; retorted Johnny Chuck indignantly. &ldquo;I've
      climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times, and if I can get a good run
      first, I can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the
      first branches&mdash;if they are not too far above ground. You ask Reddy
      Fox if I can't; he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's quite true, Johnny,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You can climb a
      little, but as a real climber you are not much of a success. You are
      better as a digger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is all right as a digger,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;My, how
      he can make the sand fly! Johnny Chuck certainly is right at home when it
      comes to digging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be thankful that he is,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;for the
      holes he has dug have saved your life more than once. By the way, Peter,
      since you are so well acquainted with those holes, suppose you tell us
      what kind of a home Johnny Chuck has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter was delighted to air his knowledge. &ldquo;The last one I was in,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and then
      straightening out. The entrance was quite large with a big heap of sand
      out in front of it. Down a little way the tunnel grew smaller and then
      remained the same size all the rest of the way. Way down at the farther
      end was a nice little bedroom with some grass in it. There were one or two
      other little rooms, and there were two branch tunnels leading up to the
      surface of the ground, making side or back doorways. There was no sand
      around either of these, and they were quite hidden by the long grass
      hanging over them. I don't understand how Johnny made those doorways
      without leaving any sand on the doorsteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; interrupted Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;That was easy enough. I pushed all the
      sand out of the main doorway so that there would be nothing to attract the
      attention of any one passing near those back doorways. Those back doorways
      are very handy in time of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always have three doorways?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Sometimes I have only two and once in a while
      only one. But that isn't really safe, and I mean always to have at least
      two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you use the same house year after year?&rdquo; piped up Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I dig a new hole each spring. Mrs.
      Chuck and I like a change of scene. Usually my new home isn't very far
      from my old one, because I am not fond of traveling. Sometimes, however,
      if we cannot find a place that just suits us, we go quite a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground?&rdquo; asked
      Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Where else would they be born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know but Mrs. Chuck might make a nest on the ground the way Mrs.
      Peter and Mrs. Jumper do,&rdquo; replied Jumper meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, siree!&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;Our babies are born in that little
      underground bedroom, and they stay down in the ground until they are big
      enough to hunt for food for themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many do you usually have?&rdquo; inquired Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six or eight,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Mrs. Chuck and I believe in large
      families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you eat nuts like the rest of our family?&rdquo; inquired Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Give me green food every time. There is
      nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass, unless it be some
      of those fine vegetables Farmer Brown grows in his garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit nodded his head very emphatically as if he quite agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are what is called a vegetarian, then,&rdquo; said Happy Jack, to
      which Johnny Chuck replied that he supposed he was. &ldquo;And I suppose that is
      why you sleep all winter,&rdquo; added Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I didn't I would starve,&rdquo; responded Johnny Chuck promptly. &ldquo;When it
      gets near time for Jack Frost to arrive, I stuff and stuff and stuff on
      the last of the good green things until I'm so fat I can hardly waddle.
      Then I go down to my bedroom, curl up and go to sleep. Cold weather, snow
      and ice don't worry me a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; spoke up Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;I sleep most of the winter myself.
      Of course I have a lot of food stored away down in my house, and once in a
      while I wake up and eat a little. Do you ever wake up in the winter,
      Johnny Chuck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Johnny. &ldquo;I sleep right through, thank goodness. Sometimes I
      wake up very early in the spring before the snow is all gone, earlier than
      I wish I did. That is where my fat comes in handy. It keeps me warm and
      keeps me alive until I can find the first green plants. Perhaps you have
      noticed that early in the spring I am as thin as I was fat in the fall.
      This is because I have used up the fat, waiting for the first green things
      to appear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have many enemies?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit, who has so many himself
      that he is constantly thinking of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many, but enough,&rdquo; growled Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote,
      men and Dogs are the worst. Of course, when I was small I always had to be
      watching out for Hawks, and of course, like all the rest of us little
      folks, I am afraid of Shadow the Weasel. Reddy Fox has tried to dig me out
      more than once, but I can dig faster than he can. If he ever gets me
      cornered, he'll find that I can fight. A small Dog surprised me once
      before I could get to my hole and I guess that Dog never will tackle
      another Woodchuck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time is up,&rdquo; interrupted Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Johnny Chuck has a big
      cousin out in the mountains of the Great West named Whistler, and on the
      prairies of the Great West he has a smaller cousin named Yap Yap. They are
      quite important members of the Marmot family, and to-morrow I'll tell you
      about them if you want me to. You need not come tomorrow, Johnny Chuck,
      unless you want to,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck hung his head, for he was a little ashamed that he had been
      so unwilling to come that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Mother Nature,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think I'll come. I didn't know
      I had any close relatives, and I want to know about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was agreed that all would be on hand at sun-up the next morning, and
      then everybody started for home to think over the things they had learned.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII Whistler and Yap Yap
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck was the first one on hand the next morning. The fact is,
      Johnny was quite excited over the discovery that he had some near
      relatives. He always had supposed that the Woodchucks were a family by
      themselves. Now that he knew that he had some close relatives, he was
      filled with quite as much curiosity as ever Peter Rabbit possessed. Just
      as soon as Old Mother Nature was ready to begin, Johnny Chuck was ready
      with a question. &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who are my nearest relatives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marmots of the Far West,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You know, you
      are a Marmot, and these cousins of yours out there are a great deal like
      you in a general way. The biggest and handsomest of all is Whistler, who
      lives in the mountains of the Northwest. The fact is, he is the biggest of
      all the Marmot family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he much bigger than Johnny Chuck?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considerably bigger,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head.
      &ldquo;Considerably bigger. I should think he would weight twice as much as
      Johnny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Johnny's eyes opened very wide. &ldquo;My!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I should like to see
      him. Does he look like me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his shape he does,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;but he has a very much
      handsomer coat. His coat is a mixture of dark brown and white hairs which
      give him a grayish color. The upper part of his head, his feet and nails
      are black, and so are his ears. A black band runs from behind each ear
      down to his neck. His chin is pure white and there is white on his nose.
      Underneath he is a light, rusty color. His fur is thicker and softer than
      yours, Johnny; this is because he lives where it is colder. His tail is
      larger, somewhat bushier, and is a blackish-brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, why is he called Whistler?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he has a sharp, clear whistle which can be heard a very long
      distance,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He sits up just as you do. If he
      sees danger approaching he whistles, as a warning to all his relatives
      within hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is foolish to ask if he lives in a hole in the ground as
      Johnny Chuck does,&rdquo; spoke up Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;All Marmots live in holes in the
      ground, but Whistler lives in entirely different country. He lives up on
      the sides of the mountains, often so high that no trees grow there and the
      ground is rocky. He digs his hole down in between the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a nice, safe hole,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;I guess he doesn't have to
      worry about being dug out by Reddy fox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You guessed quite right,&rdquo; laughed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Nevertheless, he
      has reason to fear being dug out. You see, out where he lives, Grizzly,
      the big cousin of Buster Bear, also lives, and Grizzly is very fond of a
      Marmot dinner when he can get one. He is so big and strong and has such
      great claws that he can pull the rocks apart and dig Whistler out. By the
      way, I forgot to tell you that Whistler is also called the Gray Marmot and
      the Hoary Marmot. He lives on grass and other green things and, like
      Johnny Chuck, gets very fat in the fall and then sleeps all winter. There
      are one or two other Marmots in the Far West who live farther south than
      does Whistler, but their habits are much the same as those of Whistler and
      Johnny Chuck. None of them are social. I mean by that you never find two
      Marmot homes very close together. In this they differ from Johnny's
      smaller cousin, Yap Yap the Prairie Dog. Yap Yap wouldn't be happy if he
      didn't have close neighbors of his own kind. He has one of the most social
      natures of all my little people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us about him,&rdquo; begged Happy Jack Squirrel before Johnny Chuck, who
      is naturally slow, could ask for the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yap Yap is the smallest of the Marmot family,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;In a way he is about as closely related to the Ground Squirrels as he is
      to the Marmots. Johnny Chuck has only four claws on each front foot, but
      Yap Yap has five, just as the Ground Squirrels have. He looks very much
      like a small Chuck dressed in light yellow-brown. His tail for the most
      part is the same color as his coat, but the end is black, though there is
      one member of the family whose tail has a white tip. In each cheek is a
      small pouch, that is, a small pocket, and this is one of the things that
      shows how closely related to the Spermophiles he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I said before, Yap Yap is very social by nature. He lives on the great
      open plains of the West and Southwest, frequently where it is very dry and
      rain seldom falls. When you find his home you are sure to find the homes
      of many more Prairie Dogs very close at hand. Sometimes there are hundreds
      and hundreds of homes, making a regular town. This is because the Prairie
      Dogs dearly love the company of their own kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Yap Yap dig the same kind of a hole that I do?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way it is like yours,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;but at the same
      time it is different. In the first place, it goes almost straight down for
      a long distance. In the second place there is no mound of sand in front of
      Yap Yap's doorway. Instead of that the doorway is right in the very middle
      of the mound of sand. One reason for this is that when it does rain out
      where Yap Yap lives it rains very hard indeed, so that the water stands on
      the ground for a short time. The ground being flat, a lot of water would
      run down into Yap Yap's home and make him most uncomfortable if he did not
      do something to keep it out. So he brings the sand out and piles it all
      the way around his doorway and presses it down with his nose. In that way
      he builds up a firm mound which he uses for two purposes; one is to keep
      the water from running down the hole, and the other is as a sort of watch
      tower. He sits on the top of his mound to watch for his enemies. His
      cousins with the white tail digs a hole more like yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yap Yap loves to visit his neighbors and to have them visit him. They are
      lively little people and do a great deal of talking among themselves. The
      instant one of them sees an enemy he gives a signal. Then every Prairie
      Dog scampers for his own hole and dives in head first. Almost at once he
      pops his head out again to see what the danger may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can he do that without going clear to the bottom to turn around?&rdquo;
       demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wondered if any of you would think of that question,&rdquo; chuckled Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;Just a little way down from the entrance Yap Yap digs a
      little room at one side of his tunnel. All he has to do is to scramble
      into that, turn around and then pop his head out. As I said before, his
      tunnel goes down very deep; then it turns and goes almost equally far
      underground. Down there he has a nice little bedroom. Sometimes he has
      more than one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is so dry out where he lives, how does he get water to drink?&rdquo;
       asked Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't have to drink,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Some folks think
      that he digs down until he finds water way down underneath, but this isn't
      so. He doesn't have to have water. He gets all the moisture he needs from
      the green things he eats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, like the rest of us, he has lots of enemies?&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Old Man Coyote and Reddy
      Fox are very fond of Prairie Dog. So are members of the Hawk family. Then
      in some places there is a cousin of Shadow the Weasel called the
      Black-footed Ferret. He is to be feared most of all because he can follow
      Yap Yap down into his hole. There is a cousin of Hooty the Owl called the
      Burrowing Owl because it builds its home in a hole in the ground. You are
      likely to find many Burrowing Owls living in Prairie Dog villages. Also
      you are apt to find Buzztail the Rattlesnake there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of people believe that Yap Yap, Buzztail and the little Burrowing
      Owl are the best of friends and often live together in the same hole. This
      isn't so at all. Buzztail is very fond of young Prairie Dog and so is the
      Burrowing Owl. Rather than dig a hole for himself the Owl will sometimes
      take possession of one of Yap Yap's deserted holes. If he should make a
      mistake and enter a hole in which Yap Yap was at home, the chances are
      that Yap Yap would kill the Owl for he knows that the Owl is an enemy.
      Buzztail the Rattlesnake also makes use of Prairie Dog holes, but it is
      safe to say that if there are any Prairie Dog babies down there they never
      live to see what the outside world is like. So Buzztail and the Burrowing
      Owl are really enemies instead of friends of Yap Yap, the Prairie Dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is he called a Dog?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed right out. &ldquo;Goodness knows,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He
      doesn't look like a Dog and he doesn't act like a Dog, so why people
      should call him a Dog I don't know, unless it is because of his habit of
      barking, and even his bark isn't at all like a Dog's&mdash;not nearly so
      much so as the bark of Reddy Fox. Now I guess this will do for to-day.
      Haven't you little folks had enough of school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack and Chatterer
      the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;We want to know
      about the rest of the members of the order of Rodents or Gnawers,&rdquo; added
      Peter. &ldquo;Of course in a way they are sort of related to us and we want to
      know about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;come
      again to-morrow morning and we'll see what more we can learn.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX Two Queer Little Haymakers
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is nothing like a little knowledge to make one want more. Johnny
      Chuck, who had gone to school only because Old Mother Nature had sent for
      him, had become as full of curiosity as Peter Rabbit. The discovery that
      he had a big, handsome cousin, Whistler the Marmot, living in the
      mountains of the Far West, had given Johnny something to think about. It
      seemed to Johnny such a queer place for a member of his family to live
      that he wanted to know more about it. So Johnny had a question all ready
      when Old Mother Nature called school to order the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, Mother Nature,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;does my cousin, Whistler, have
      any neighbors up among those rocks where he lives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly does,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, nodding her head. &ldquo;He has
      for a near neighbor one of the quaintest and most interesting little
      members of the big order to which you all belong. And that order is what?&rdquo;
       she asked abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The order of Rodents,&rdquo; replied Peter Rabbit promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, Peter,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, smiling at Peter. &ldquo;I asked that
      just to see if you really are learning. I wanted to make sure that I am
      not wasting my time with you little folks. Now this little neighbor of
      Whistler is Little Chief Hare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare pricked up their long ears and
      became more interested than ever, if that were possible. &ldquo;I thought you
      had told us all about our family,&rdquo; cried Jumper, &ldquo;but you didn't mention
      Little Chief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;I didn't, and the reason I didn't was
      because Little Chief isn't a member of your family. He is called Little
      Chief Hare, but he isn't a Hare at all, although he looks much like a
      small Rabbit with short hind legs and rounded ears. He has a family all to
      himself and should be called a Pika. Some folks do call him that, but more
      call him a Cony, and some call him the Crying Hare. This is because he
      uses his voice a great deal, which is something no member of the Hare
      family does. In size he is just about as big as one of your half-grown
      babies, Peter, so, you see, he really is a very little fellow. His coat is
      grayish-brown. His ears are of good size, but instead of being long, are
      round. He has small bright eyes. His legs are short, his hind legs being
      very little longer than his front ones. He has hair on the soles of his
      feet just like the members of the hare family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about his tail?&rdquo; piped up Peter Rabbit. You know Peter is very much
      interested in tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;He is worse off than you, Peter,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;for he hasn't any at all. That is, he hasn't any that can be seen. He
      lives way up among the rocks of the great mountains above where the trees
      grow and often is a very near neighbor to Whistler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that means that he makes his home down in under rocks, the same
      as Whistler does,&rdquo; spoke up Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is such a little fellow that he
      can get through very narrow places, and he has his home and barns way down
      in among the rocks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barns!&rdquo; exclaimed Happy Jack Squirrel. &ldquo;Barns! What do you mean by
      barns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;I just call them barns,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;because
      they are the places where he stores away his hay, just as Farmer Brown
      stores away his hay in his barn. I suppose you would call them
      storehouses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of hay, Peter Rabbit sat bolt upright and his eyes were
      wide open with astonishment. &ldquo;Did you say hay?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Where under
      the sun does he get hay way up there, and what does he want of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a twinkle in Old Mother Nature's eyes as she replied, &ldquo;He makes
      that hay just as you see Farmer Brown make hay every summer. It is what he
      lives on in the winter and in bad weather. Little Chief knows just as much
      about the proper way of making hay as Farmer Brown does. Even way up among
      the rocks there are places where grass and peas-vines and other green
      things grow. Little Chief lives on these in summer. But he is as wise and
      thrifty as any Squirrel, another way in which he differs from the Hare
      family. He cuts them when they are ready for cutting and spreads them out
      on the rocks to dry in the sun. He knows that if he should take them down
      into his barns while they are fresh and green they would sour and spoil;
      so he never stores them away until they are thoroughly dry. Then, of
      course, they are hay, for hay is nothing but sun-dried grass cut before it
      has begun to die. When his hay is just as dry as it should be, he takes it
      down and stores it away in his barns, which are nothing but little caves
      down in among the rocks. There he has it for use in winter when there is
      no green food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Chief is so nearly the color of the rocks that it takes sharp eyes
      to see him when he is sitting still. He has a funny little squeaking
      voice, and he uses it a great deal. It is a funny voice because it is hard
      to tell just where it comes from. It seems to come from nowhere in
      particular. Sometimes he can be heard squeaking way down in his home under
      the rocks. Like Johnny Chuck, he prefers to sleep at night and be abroad
      during the day. Because he is so small he must always be on the lookout
      for enemies. At the first hint of danger he scampers to safety in among
      the rocks, and there he scolds whoever has frightened him. There is no
      more loveable little person in all my great family than this little
      haymaker of the mountains of the Great West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That haymaking is a pretty good idea of Little Chief's,&rdquo; remarked Peter
      Rabbit, scratching a long ear with a long hind foot. &ldquo;I've a great mind to
      try it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed right out, for everybody knew just how easy-going and
      thriftless Peter was. Peter himself grinned. He couldn't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a very good idea, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;By the
      way, there is another haymaker out in those same great mountains of the
      Far West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Peter and Johnny Chuck and Happy Jack Squirrel, all in the
      same breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stubtail the Mountain Beaver,&rdquo; declared Peter promptly. &ldquo;I suppose
      Stubtail is his cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No. Stubtail and Paddy
      are no more closely related than the rest of you. Stubtail isn't a Beaver
      at all. His proper name is Sewellel. Sometimes he is called Showt'l and
      sometimes the Boomer, and sometimes the Chehalis, but most folks call him
      the Mountain Beaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because he looks like Paddy the Beaver?&rdquo; Striped Chipmunk asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He looks more like Jerry Muskrat than he
      does like Paddy. He is about Jerry's size and looks very much as Jerry
      would if he had no tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't he any tail at all?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has a little tail, a little stub of a tail, but it is so small
      that to look at him you would think he hadn't any,&rdquo; replied Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;He is found out in the same mountains of the Far West where
      Whistler and Little Chief live, but instead of living way up high among
      the rocks he is at home down in the valleys where the ground is soft and
      the trees grow thickly. Stubtail has no use for rocks. He wants soft, wet
      ground where he can tunnel and tunnel to his heart's content. In one thing
      Stubtail is very like Yap Yap the Prairie Dog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck quickly, for, you know, Yap Yap is
      Johnny's cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his social habits,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Stubtail isn't fond of
      living alone. He wants company of his own kind. So wherever you find
      Stubtail you are likely to find many of his family. They like to go
      visiting back and forth. They make little paths between their homes and
      all about through the thick ferns, and they keep these little paths free
      and clear, so that they may run along them easily. Some of these little
      paths lead into long tunnels. These are made for safety. Usually the
      ground is so wet that there will be water running in the bottoms of these
      little tunnels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a house does Stubtail have?&rdquo; inquired Johnny Chuck
      interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hole in the ground, of course,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;It is dug
      where the ground is drier than where the runways are made. Mrs. Stubtail
      makes a nest of dried ferns and close by they build two or three
      storehouses, for Stubtail and Mrs. Stubtail are thrifty people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he fills them with hay, for you said he is a haymaker,&rdquo;
       remarked Happy Jack Squirrel, who is always interested in storehouses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;he puts hay in them. He cuts grasses,
      ferns, pea-vines and other green plants and carries them in little bundles
      to the entrance to his tunnel. There he piles them on sticks so as to keep
      them off he damp ground and so that the air can help dry them out. When
      they are dry, he takes them inside and stores them away. He also stores
      other things. He likes the roots of ferns. He cuts tender, young twigs
      from bushes and stores away some of these. He is fond of bark. In winter
      he is quite as active as in summer and tunnels about under the snow. Then
      he sometimes has Peter Rabbit's bad habit of killing trees by gnawing bark
      all around as high up as he can reach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can he climb trees?&rdquo; asked Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about as much as Johnny Chuck can,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;Sometimes he climbs up in low bushes or in small, low-branching trees to
      cut off tender shoots, but he doesn't do much of this sort of thing. His
      home is the ground. He is most active at night, but where undisturbed, is
      out more or less during the day. When he wants to cut off a twig he sits
      up like a Squirrel and holds the twig in his hands while he bites it off
      with his sharp teeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't tell us what color his coat is,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you he looked very much like Jerry Muskrat,&rdquo; replied Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;His coat is brown, much the color of Jerry's, but his fur is not
      nearly so soft and fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he has enemies just as the rest of us little people have,&rdquo; said
      Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;All little people have enemies,
      and most big ones too, for that matter. King Eagle is one and Yowler the
      Bob Cat is another. They are always watching for Stubtail. That is why he
      digs so many tunnels. He can travel under the ground then. My goodness,
      how time flies! Scamper home, all of you, for I have too much to do to
      talk any more to-day.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X Prickly Porky and Grubby Gopher
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the way to school the next morning Peter Rabbit wondered who they
      would learn about that day. He was so busy wondering that he was heedless.
      Peter is apt to be heedless at times. The result was that as he hopped out
      of a bramble-tangle just within the edge of the Green Forest, he all but
      landed in something worse than the worst brambles that ever grew. It was
      only by a wild side jump that he saved himself. Peter had almost landed
      among the thousand little spears of Prickly Porky the Porcupine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you look where you are going,&rdquo; grunted Prickly Porky. Plainly
      he was rather peevish. &ldquo;It wouldn't be my fault if you had a few of my
      little spears sticking in you this very minute, and it would serve you
      right.&rdquo; He waddled along a few steps, then began talking again. &ldquo;I don't
      see why Old Mother Nature sent for me this morning,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;I hate
      a long walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter pricked up his long ears. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You're going to
      school, Prickly Porky. You're a Rodent, and we are going to learn all
      about you this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a Rodent; I'm a Porcupine,&rdquo; grunted Prickly Porky indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a Rodent just the same. You've got big gnawing teeth, and any one
      with that kind of teeth is a Rodent,&rdquo; retorted Peter. Then at a sudden
      thought a funny look passed over his face. &ldquo;Why, that means that you and I
      are related in a way,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't believe it,&rdquo; grunted Prickly Porky, still shuffling along. &ldquo;Don't
      believe it. Don't want to be related to anybody as heedless as you. What
      is this school, anyway? Don't want to go to school. Know all I want to
      know. Know how to get all I want to eat and how to make everybody get out
      of my way and leave me alone, and that's enough to know.&rdquo; He rattled the
      thousand little spears hidden in his coat, and Peter shivered at the
      sound. It was a most unpleasant sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some folks do like to be stupid,&rdquo; snapped Peter and hurried on,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, while Prickly Porky slowly shuffled and rattled
      along behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the others were there when Peter arrived. Prickly Porky wasn't even in
      sight. Old Mother Nature wasted no time. She has too much to do ever to
      waste time. She called the school to order at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;I told you about two little haymakers of the high
      mountains of the Far West. Who were they, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Chief Hare, called the Pika or Cony, and Stubtail the Mountain
      Beaver or Sewellel,&rdquo; replied Peter with great promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now I am going to tell you of one of my
      little plowmen who also lives in the Far West but prefers the great plains
      to the high mountains, though he is sometimes found in the latter. He is
      Grubby the Gopher, a member of the same order the rest of you belong to,
      but of a family quite his own. He is properly called the Pocket Gopher,
      and way down in the Southeast, where he is also found, he is called a
      Salamander, though what for I haven't the least idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he have pockets in his cheeks like mine?&rdquo; asked Striped Chipmunk
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has pockets in his cheeks, and that is why he is called Pocket
      Gopher,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature; &ldquo;but they are not at all like yours,
      Striped Chipmunk. Yours are on the inside of your cheeks, but his are on
      the outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; exclaimed Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pockets are small compared with those of Grubby,&rdquo; continued Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;One of his covers almost the whole side of his head back
      to his short neck, and it is lined with fur, and remember he has two of
      them. Grubby uses these for carrying food and never for carrying out earth
      when he is digging a tunnel, as some folks think he does. He stuffs them
      full with his front feet and empties them by pressing them from the back
      with his feet. The Gopher family is quite large and the members range in
      size from the size of Danny Meadow Mouse to that of Robber the Rat, only
      these bigger members are stouter and heavier than Robber. Some are
      reddish-brown and some are gray. But whatever his size and wherever he is
      found, Grubby's habits are the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Peter Rabbit had been fidgeting about. It was quite clear
      that Peter had something on his mind. Now as Old Mother Nature paused,
      Peter found the chance he had been waiting for. &ldquo;If you please, why did
      you call him a plowman?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm coming to that all in due time,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, smiling
      at Peter's eagerness. &ldquo;Grubby Gopher spends most of his life underground,
      very much like Miner the Mole, whom you all know. He can dig tunnels just
      about as fast. His legs are short, and his front legs and feet are very
      stout and strong. They are armed with very long, strong claws and it is
      with these and the help of his big cutting teeth that Grubby digs. He
      throws the earth under him and then kicks it behind him with his hind
      feet. When he has quite a pile behind him he turns around, and with his
      front feet and head pushes it along to a little side tunnel and then up to
      the surface of the ground. As soon as he has it all out he plugs up the
      opening and goes back to digging. The loose earth he has pushed out makes
      little mounds, and he makes one of these mounds every few feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grubby is a great worker. He is very industrious. Since he is
      underground, it doesn't make much difference to him whether it be night or
      day. In summer, during the hottest part of the day, he rests. His eyes are
      small and weak because he has little use for them, coming out on the
      surface very seldom and then usually in the dusk. He has a funny little
      tail without any hair on it; this is very sensitive and serves him as a
      sort of guide when he runs backward along his tunnel, which he can do
      quite fast. A funny thing about those long claws on his front feet is that
      he folds them under when he is walking or running. Do any of you know why
      Farmer Brown plows his garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she asked this, Old Mother Nature looked from one to another, and each
      in turn shook his head. &ldquo;It is to mix the dead vegetable matter thoroughly
      with the earth so that the roots of the plants may get it easily,&rdquo;
       explained Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;By making those tunnels in every direction
      and bringing up the earth below to the surface, Grubby Gopher does the
      same thing. That is why I call him my little plowman. He loosens up the
      hard, packed earth and mixes the vegetable matter with it and so makes it
      easy for seeds to sprout and plants to grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he must be one of the farmer's best friends,&rdquo; spoke up Happy Jack
      Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;He has been in the past,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He
      has done a wonderful work in helping make the land fit for farming. But
      where land is being farmed he is a dreadful pest, I am sorry to say. You
      see he eats the crops the farmer tries to raise, and the new mounds he is
      all the time throwing up bury a lot of the young plants, and in the
      meadows make it very hard to use a mowing machine for cutting hay. Then
      Grubby gets into young orchards and cuts off all the tender roots of young
      trees. This kills them. You see he is fond of tender roots, seeds, stems
      of grass and grain, and is never happier than when he can find a field of
      potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being such a worker, he has to have a great deal to eat. Then, too, he
      stores away a great deal for winter, for he doesn't sleep in winter as
      Johnny Chuck does. He even tunnels about under the snow. Sometimes he
      fills these little snow tunnels with the earth he brings up from below,
      and when the snow melts it leaves queer little earth ridges to show where
      the tunnels were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grubby is very neat in his habits and keeps his home and himself very
      clean. During the day he leaves one of his mounds open for a little while
      to let in fresh air. But it is only for a little while. Then he closes it
      again. He doesn't dare leave it open very long, for fear Shadow the Weasel
      or a certain big Snake called the Gopher Snake will find it and come in
      after him. Digger the Badger is the only one of his enemies who can dig
      fast enough to dig him out, but at night, when he likes to come out for a
      little air or to cut grain and grass, he must always watch for Hooty the
      Owl. Old Man Coyote and members of the Hawk family are always looking for
      him by day, so you see he has plenty of enemies, like the rest of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He got the name Gopher because that comes from a word meaning honeycomb,
      and Grubby's tunnels go in every direction until the ground is like
      honeycomb. He isn't a bit social and has rather a mean disposition. He is
      always ready to fight. On the plains he has done a great deal to make the
      soil fine and rich, as I have already told you, but on hillsides he does a
      great deal of harm. The water runs down his tunnels and washes away the
      soil. Because of this and the damage he does to crops, man is his greatest
      enemy. But man has furnished him with new and splendid foods easy to get,
      and so Grubby's family increases faster than it used to, in spite of traps
      and poison. Hello! See who's here! It is about time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a shuffling and rattling and grunting, and Prickly Porky climbed
      up on an old stump, looking very peevish and much out of sorts. He had
      come to school much against his will.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI A Fellow With a Thousand Spears
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, pointing to Prickly Porky the Porcupine,
      &ldquo;is next to the largest member of your order, which is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order of Rodents,&rdquo; piped up Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not only next to the largest, but is the stupidest,&rdquo; continued Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;At least that is what people say of him, though I suspect
      he isn't as stupid as he sometimes seems. Anyway, he manages to keep well
      fed and escape his enemies, which is more than can be said for some others
      who are supposed to have quick wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Escaping his enemies is no credit to him. They are only too glad to keep
      out of his way; he doesn't have to fear anybody,&rdquo; said Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel to his cousin, Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      His remark didn't escape the keen ears of Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Are you sure
      about that?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Now there's Pekan the Fisher-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by a great rattling on the old stump. Everybody turned
      to look. There was Prickly Porky backing down as fast as he could, which
      wasn't fast at all, and rattling his thousand little spears as he did so.
      It was really very funny. Everybody had to laugh, even Old Mother Nature.
      You see, it was plain that he was in a great hurry, yet every movement was
      slow and clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Prickly Porky, what does this mean? Where are you going?&rdquo; demanded
      Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prickly Porky turned his dull-looking eyes towards her, and in them was a
      troubled, worried look. &ldquo;Where's Pekan the Fisher?&rdquo; he asked, and his
      voice shook a little with something very much like fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature understood instantly. When she had said, &ldquo;Now there's
      Pekan the Fisher,&rdquo; Prickly Porky had waited to hear no more. He had
      instantly thought that she meant that Pekan was right there somewhere.
      &ldquo;It's all right, Prickly Porky,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Pekan isn't anywhere around
      here, so climb back on that stump and don't worry. Had you waited for me
      to finish, you would have saved yourself a fright. Chatterer had just said
      that you didn't have to fear anybody and I was starting to explain that he
      was wrong, that despite your thousand little spears you have reason to
      fear Pekan the Fisher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prickly Porky shivered and this made the thousand little spears in his
      coat rattle. It was such a surprising thing to see Prickly Porky actually
      afraid that the other little folks almost doubted their own eyes. &ldquo;Are you
      quite sure that Pekan isn't anywhere around?&rdquo; asked Prickly Porky, and his
      voice still shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;If he were I wouldn't allow him
      to hurt you. You ought to know that. Now sit up so that every one can get
      a good look at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Prickly Porky sat up, and the others gathered around the foot of the stump
      to look at him. &ldquo;He certainly is no beauty,&rdquo; murmured Happy Jack Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack was quite right. He was anything but handsome. The truth is he
      was the homeliest, clumsiest-looking fellow in all the Green Forest. He
      was a little bigger than Bobby Coon and his body was thick and
      heavy-looking. His back humped up like an arch. His head was rather small
      for the size of his body, short and rather round. His neck was even
      shorter. His eyes were small and very dull. It was plain that he couldn't
      see far, or clearly unless what he was looking at was close at hand. His
      ears were small and nearly hidden in hair. His front teeth, the gnawing
      teeth which showed him to be a Rodent, were very large and bright orange.
      His legs were short and stout. He had four toes on each front foot and
      five on each hind foot, and these were armed with quite long, stout claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the queerest thing and the most interesting thing about Prickly Porky
      was his coat. Not one among the other little people of the Green Forest
      has a coat anything like his. Most of them have a soft, short under fur
      protected and more or less hidden by longer, coarser hair. Prickly Porky
      had the long coarse hair and on his back it was very long and coarse,
      brownish-black in color up to the tips, which were white. Under this long
      hair was some soft woolly fur, but what that long hair hid chiefly was an
      array of wicked-looking little spears called quills. They were white to
      the tips, which were dark and very, very sharply pointed. All down the
      sides were tiny barbs, so small as hardly to be seen, but there just the
      same. On his head the quills were about an inch long, but on his back they
      were four inches long, becoming shorter towards the tail. The latter was
      rather short, stout, and covered with short quills.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat there on that old stump some of Prickly Porky's little spears
      could be seen peeping out from the long hair on his back, but they didn't
      look particularly dangerous. Peter Rabbit suddenly made a discovery.
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He hasn't any little spears on the under side of
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wondered who would be the first to notice that,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;No, Prickly Porky hasn't any little spears underneath, and Pekan
      the Fisher has found that out. He knows that if he can turn Prickly Porky
      on his back he can kill him without much danger from those little spears,
      and he has learned how to do that very thing. That is why Prickly Porky is
      afraid of him. Now, Prickly Porky, climb down off that stump and show
      these little folks what you do when an enemy comes near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grumbling and growling, Prickly Porky climbed down to the ground. Then he
      tucked his head down between his front paws and suddenly the thousand
      little spears appeared all over him, pointing in every direction until he
      looked like a giant chestnut burr. Then he began to thrash his tail from
      side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he doing that for?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck, looking rather puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go near enough to be hit by it, and you'll understand,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature dryly. &ldquo;That is his one weapon. Whoever is hit by that tail will
      find himself full of those little spears and will take care never to go
      near Prickly Porky again. Once those little spears have entered the skin,
      they keep working in deeper and deeper, and more than one of his enemies
      has been killed by them. On account of those tiny barbs they are hard to
      pull out, and pulling them out hurts dreadfully. Just try one and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one was anxious to try, so Old Mother Nature paused only a moment.
      &ldquo;You will notice that he moves that tail quickly,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;It is
      the only thing about him which is quick. When he has a chance, in time of
      danger, he likes to get his head under a log or rock, instead of putting
      it between his paws as he is doing now. Then he plants his feet firmly and
      waits for a chance to use that tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true that he can throw those little spears at folks?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;There isn't a word of truth in it,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;That story probably was started by some one who was hit by his
      tail, and it was done so quickly that the victim didn't see the tail move
      and so thought the little spears were thrown at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he make all those little spears stand up that way?&rdquo; asked Jumper
      the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has a special set of muscles for just that purpose,&rdquo; explained Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When those quills stick into some one they must pull out of Prickly
      Porky's own skin; I should think that would hurt him,&rdquo; spoke up Striped
      Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;They are very loosely fastened
      in his skin and come out at the least little pull. New Ones grow to take
      the place of those he loses. Notice that he puts his whole foot flat on
      the ground just as Buster Bear and Bobby Coon do, and just as those
      two-legged creatures called men do. Very few animals do this, and those
      that do are said to be plantigrade. Now, Prickly Porky, tell us what you
      eat and where you make your home, and that will end today's lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I eat bark, twigs and leaves mostly,&rdquo; grunted Prickly Porky ungraciously.
      &ldquo;I like hemlock best of all, but also eat poplar, pine and other trees for
      a change. Sometimes I stay in a tree for days until I have stripped it of
      all its bark and leaves. I don't see any sense in moving about any more
      than is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that must kill the tree!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; demanded Prickly Porky crossly. &ldquo;There are plenty of
      trees. In summer I like lily pads and always get them when I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; grunted Prickly Porky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never see you out on the Green Meadows,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you never will,&rdquo; retorted Prickly Porky. &ldquo;The Green Forest for me
      every time. Summer or winter, I'm at home there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you sleep through the cold weather the way Buster Bear and I do?&rdquo;
       asked Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I sleep for?&rdquo; grumbled Prickly Porky. &ldquo;Cold weather doesn't
      bother me. I like it. I have the Green Forest pretty much to myself then.
      I like to be alone. And as long as there are trees, there is plenty to
      eat. I sleep a great deal in the daytime because I like night best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about your home?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home is wherever I happen to be, most of the time, but Mrs. Porky has a
      home in a hollow log or a cave or under the roots of a tree where the
      babies are born. I guess that's all I've got to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might add that those babies are big for the size of their mother and
      have a full supply of quills when they are born,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;And you forgot to say how fond of salt you are, and how often this
      fondness gets you into trouble around the camps of men. Your fear of Pekan
      the Fisher we all saw. I might add that Puma the Panther is to be feared
      at times, and when he is very hungry Buster Bear will take a chance on
      turning you on your back. By the way, don't any of you call Prickly Porky
      a Hedgehog. He isn't any thing of the kind. He is sometimes called a Quill
      Pig, but his real name, Porcupine, is best. He has no near relatives.
      Tomorrow morning, instead of meeting here, we'll hold school on the shore
      of the pond Paddy the Beaver has made. School is dismissed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII A Lumberman and Engineer
    </h2>
    <p>
      Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk were the only ones who were not on hand
      at the pond of Paddy the Beaver deep in the Green Forest at sun-up the
      next morning. Johnny and Striped Chipmunk were afraid to go so far from
      home. To the surprise of everybody, Prickly Porky was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have traveled all night to get here he is such a slow-poke,&rdquo; said
      Peter Rabbit to his cousin, Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter wasn't far from the truth. But how ever he got there, there he was,
      reaching for lily pads from an old log which lay half in the water, and
      appearing very well satisfied with life. You know there is nothing like a
      good meal of things you like, to make everything seem just as it should.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature seated herself on one end of Paddy's dam and called the
      school to order. Just as she did so a brown head popped out of the water
      close by and a pair of anxious eyes looked up at Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite all right, Paddy,&rdquo; said she softly. &ldquo;These little folks are
      trying to gain a little knowledge of themselves and other folks, and we
      are going to have this morning's lesson right here because it is to be
      about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy the Beaver no longer looked anxious. There was a sparkle in his
      eyes. &ldquo;May I stay?&rdquo; he asked eagerly. &ldquo;If there is a chance to learn
      anything I don't want to miss it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Old Mother Nature could reply Peter Rabbit spoke up. &ldquo;But the
      lesson is to be about you and your family. Do you expect to learn anything
      about yourself?&rdquo; he demanded, and chuckled as if he thought that a great
      joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that some one named Peter learned a great deal about his
      own family when he first came to school to me,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      Peter had grace enough to hang his head and look ashamed. &ldquo;Of course you
      may stay, Paddy. In fact, I want you to. There are some things I shall
      want you to explain. That is why we are holding school over here this
      morning. Just come up here on your dam where we can all get a good look at
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy the Beaver climbed out on his dam. It was the first time Happy Jack
      Squirrel ever had seen him out of water, and Happy Jack gave a little gasp
      of surprise. &ldquo;I had no idea he is so big!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the biggest of all the Rodents in this country, and one of the
      biggest in all the Great World. Also he is the smartest member of the
      whole order,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't look it,&rdquo; said Chatterer the Squirrel with a saucy jerk of his
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means, I suppose, that you haven't the least doubt that you are
      quite as smart as he,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature quietly, and Chatterer
      looked both guilty and a little bit ashamed. &ldquo;I'll admit that you are
      smart, Chatterer, but often it is in a wrong way. Paddy is smart in the
      very best way. He is a lumberman, builder and engineer. A lot of my little
      people are workers, but they are destructive workers. The busier they are,
      the more they destroy. Paddy the Beaver is a constructive worker. That
      means that he is a builder instead of a destroyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about all those trees he cuts down? If that isn't destroying, I don't
      know what is!&rdquo; said Chatterer, and with each word jerked his tail as if
      somehow his tongue and tail were connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature good-naturedly. &ldquo;But just think of
      the number of trees you destroy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have destroyed a tree in my life!&rdquo; declared Chatterer
      indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; retorted Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never have!&rdquo; contradicted Chatterer, quite forgetting to whom he was
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Old Mother Nature overlooked this. &ldquo;I don't suppose you ever ate a
      chestnut or a fat hickory nut or a sweet beechnut,&rdquo; said she softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; retorted Chatterer sharply. &ldquo;I've eaten ever and ever and
      ever so many of them. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the heart of each one was a little tree, explained Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;But for you very many of those little trees would have sprung up and some
      day would have made big trees. So you see for every tree Paddy has
      destroyed you probably have destroyed a hundred. You eat the nuts that you
      may live. Paddy cuts down the trees that he may live, for the bark of
      those trees is his food. Like Prickly Porky he lives chiefly on bark. But,
      unlike Prickly Porky, he doesn't destroy a tree for the bark alone. He
      wastes nothing. He makes use of every bit of that tree. He does something
      for the Green Forest in return for the trees he takes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer looked at Happy Jack and blinked in a puzzled way. Happy Jack
      looked at Peter Rabbit and blinked. Peter looked at Jumper the Hare and
      blinked. Jumper looked at Prickly Porky and blinked. Then all looked at
      Paddy the Beaver and finally at Old Mother Nature, and all blinked. Old
      Mother Nature chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think the Green Forest is more beautiful because of this little
      pond?&rdquo; she asked. Everybody nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;But there
      wouldn't be any little pond here were it not for Paddy and the trees he
      has cut. He destroyed the trees in order to make the pond. That is what I
      meant when I called him a constructive worker. Now I want you all to take
      a good look at Paddy. Then he will show us just how as a lumberman he cuts
      trees, as a builder he constructs houses and dams, and as an engineer he
      digs canals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Paddy sat there on his dam, he looked rather like a giant member of the
      Rat family, though his head was more like that of a Squirrel than a Rat.
      His body was very thick and heavy, and in color he was dark brown, lighter
      underneath than above. Squatting there on the dam his back was rounded.
      All together, he was a very clumsy-looking fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit appeared to be interested in just one thing, Paddy's tail. He
      couldn't keep his eyes off it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature noticed this. &ldquo;Well, Peter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what have you on
      your mind now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tail,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;That's the queerest tail I've ever seen. I
      should think it would be heavy and dreadfully in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;If you ask him Paddy will tell you that that
      tail is the handiest tail in the Green Forest,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There isn't
      another like it in all the Great World, and if you'll be patient you will
      see just how handy it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a queer-looking tail. It was broad and thick and flat, oval in
      shape, and covered with scales instead of hair. Just then Jumper the Hare
      made a discovery. &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Paddy has feet like Honker the
      Goose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only my hind feet,&rdquo; said Paddy. &ldquo;They have webs between the toes just as
      Honker's have. That is for swimming. But there are no webs between my
      fingers.&rdquo; He held up a hand for all to see. Sure enough, the fingers were
      free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that everybody has had a good look at you, Paddy,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature, &ldquo;suppose you swim over to where you have been cutting trees. We
      will join you there, and then you can show us just how you work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy slipped into the water, where for a second or two he floated with
      just his head above the surface. Then he quickly raised his broad, heavy
      tail and brought it down on the water with a slap that sounded like the
      crack of a terrible gun. It was so loud and unexpected that every one save
      Old Mother Nature and Prickly Porky jumped with fright. Peter Rabbit
      happened to be right on the edge of the dam and, because he jumped before
      he had time to think, he jumped right into the water with a splash. Now
      Peter doesn't like the water, as you know, and he scrambled out just as
      fast as ever he could. How the others did laugh at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do that for?&rdquo; demanded Peter indignantly. &ldquo;To show you one
      use he has for that handy tail,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;That is the
      way he gives warning to his friends whenever he discovers danger. Did you
      notice how he used his tail to aid him in swimming? He turns it almost on
      edge and uses it as a rudder. Those big, webbed hind feet are the paddles
      which drive him through the water. He can stay under water a long time&mdash;as
      much as five minutes. See, he has just come up now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, Paddy's head had just appeared clear across the pond almost
      to the opposite shore, and he was now swimming on the surface. Old Mother
      Nature at once led the way around the pond to a small grove of poplar
      trees which stood a little way back from the water. Paddy was already
      there. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature &ldquo;show us what kind of a lumberman you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy picked out a small tree, sat up much as Happy Jack Squirrel does,
      but with his big flat tail on the ground to brace him, seized the trunk of
      the tree in both hands, and went to work with his great orange-colored
      cutting teeth. He bit out a big chip. Then another and another. Gradually
      he worked around the tree. After a while the tree began to sway and crack.
      Paddy bit out two or three more chips, then suddenly slapped the ground
      with his tail as a warning and scampered back to a safe distance. He was
      taking no chances of being caught under that falling tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree fell, and at once Paddy returned to work. The smaller branches he
      cut off with a single bite at the base of each. The larger ones required a
      number of bites. Then he set to work to cut the trunk up in short logs. At
      this point Old Mother Nature interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now show us,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what you do with the logs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy at once got behind a log, and by pushing, rolled it ahead of him
      until at last it fell with a splash in the water of a ditch or canal which
      led from near that grove of trees to the pond. Paddy followed into the
      water and began to push it ahead of him towards the pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; spoke up Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Come out and show us how you
      take the branches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently Paddy climbed out and returned to the fallen tree. There he
      picked up one of the long branches in his mouth, grasping it near the
      butt, twisted it over his shoulder and started to drag it to the canal.
      When he reached the latter he entered the water and began swimming, still
      dragging the branch in the same way. Once more Old Mother Nature stopped
      him. &ldquo;You've shown us how you cut trees and move them, so now I want you
      to answer a few questions,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paddy climbed out and squatted on the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did this canal happen to be here handy?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I dug it, of course,&rdquo; replied Paddy looking surprised. &ldquo;You see, I'm
      rather slow and clumsy on land, and don't like to be far from water. Those
      trees are pretty well back from the pond, so I dug this canal, which
      brings the water almost to them. It makes it safer for me in case Old Man
      Coyote or Buster Bear or Yowler the Bobcat happens to be looking for a
      Beaver dinner. Also it makes it very much easier to get my logs and
      branches to the pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I want the rest of you to
      notice how well this canal has been dug. At the other end it is carried
      along the bottom of the pond where the water is shallow so as to give
      greater depth. Now you will understand why I called Paddy an engineer.
      What do you do with your logs and branches, Paddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put them in my food-pile, out there where the water is deep near my
      house,&rdquo; replied Paddy promptly. &ldquo;The bark I eat, and the bare sticks I use
      to keep my house and dam in repair. In the late fall I cut enough trees to
      keep me in food all winter. When my pond is covered with ice I have
      nothing to worry about; my food supply is below the ice. When I am hungry
      I swim out under the ice, get a stick, take it back into my house and eat
      the bark. Then I take the bare stick outside to use when needed on my dam
      or house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to make this fine pond?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I just happened to come exploring up the Laughing Brook and found
      there was plenty of food here and a good place for a pond,&rdquo; replied Paddy.
      &ldquo;I thought I would like to live here. Down where my dam is, the Laughing
      Brook was shallow&mdash;just the place for a dam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us why you wanted a pond and how you built that dam,&rdquo; commanded Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I had to have a pond, if I was to stay here,&rdquo; replied Paddy, as if
      every one must understand that. &ldquo;The Laughing Brook wasn't deep or big
      enough for me to live here safely. If it had been, I would have made my
      home in the bank and not bothered with a house or dam. But it wasn't, so I
      had to make a pond. It required a lot of hard work, but it is worth all it
      cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I cut a lot of brush and young trees and placed them in the
      Laughing Brook in that shallow place, with the butts pointing up-stream. I
      kept them in place by piling mud and stones on them. Then I kept piling on
      more sticks and brush and mud. The water brought down leaves and floating
      stuff, and this caught in the dam and helped fill it in. I dug a lot of
      mud in front of it and used this to fill in the spaces between the sticks.
      This made the water deeper in front of the dam and at the same time kept
      it from getting through. As the water backed up, of course it made a pond.
      I kept making my dam longer and higher, and the longer and higher it
      became the bigger the pond grew. When it was big enough and deep enough to
      suit me, I stopped work on the dam and built my house out there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody turned to look at Paddy's house, the roof of which stood high
      out of water a little way from the dam. &ldquo;Tell us how you built that,&rdquo; said
      Old Mother Nature quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I just made a big platform of sticks and mud out there where it was
      deep enough for me to be sure that the water could not freeze clear to the
      bottom, even in the coldest weather,&rdquo; replied Paddy, in a matter-of-fact
      tone. &ldquo;I built it up until it was above water. Then I built the walls and
      roof of sticks and mud, just as you see them there. Inside I have a fine
      big room with a comfortable bed of shredded wood. I have two openings in
      the floor with a long passage leading from each down through the
      foundations and opening at the bottom of the pond. Of course, these are
      filled with water. Some houses have only one passage, but I like two.
      These are the only entrances to my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every fall I repair my walls and roof, adding sticks and mud and turf, so
      that now they are very thick. Late in the fall I sometimes plaster the
      outside with mud. This freezes hard, and no enemy who may reach my house
      on the ice can tear it open. I guess that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit drew a long breath. &ldquo;What dreadful lot of work,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do
      you work all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Paddy chuckled. &ldquo;No, Peter,&rdquo; said he. And Old Mother Nature nodded in
      approval. &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Quite right. Are there any more
      questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you eat nothing but bark?&rdquo; It was Happy Jack Squirrel who spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Paddy. &ldquo;In summer I eat berries, mushrooms, grass and
      the leaves and stems of a number of plants. In winter I vary my fare with
      lily roots and the roots of alder and willow. But bark is my principal
      food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature waited a few minutes, but as there were no more
      questions she added a few words. &ldquo;Now I hope you understand why I am so
      proud of Paddy the Beaver, and why I told you that he is a lumberman,
      builder and engineer,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;For the next lesson we will take up the
      Rat family.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII A Worker and a Robber
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we come to the largest family of the Rodent order, the Rat family,
      which of course includes the Mice,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, after calling
      school to order at the old meeting-place. &ldquo;And the largest member of the
      family reminds me very much of the one we learned about yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; cried Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;You mean Jerry Muskrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the head of the class, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, smiling.
      &ldquo;Jerry is the very one, the largest member of the Rat family. Sometimes he
      is spoken of as a little cousin of Paddy the Beaver. Probably this is
      because he looks something like a small Beaver, builds a house in the
      water as Paddy does, and lives in very much the same way. The truth is, he
      is no more closely related to Paddy than he is to the rest of you. He is a
      true Rat. He is called Muskrat because he carries with him a scent called
      musk. It is not an unpleasant scent, like that of Jimmy Skunk, and isn't
      used for the same purpose. Jerry uses his to tell his friends where he has
      been. He leaves a little of it at the places he visits. Some folks call
      him Musquash, but Muskrat is better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry is seldom found far from the water and then only when he is seeking
      a new home. He is rather slow and awkward on land; but in the water he is
      quite at home, as all of you know who have visited the Smiling Pool. He
      can dive and swim under water a long distance, though not as far as Paddy
      the Beaver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he webbed hind feet like Paddy?&rdquo; piped up Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;They are not fully webbed as
      Paddy's are, but there is a little webbing between some of the toes,
      enough to be of great help in swimming. His tail is of greater use in
      swimming than is Paddy's. It is bare and scaly, but instead of being flat
      top and bottom it is flattened on the sides, and he uses it as a
      propeller, moving it rapidly from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Paddy he has a dark brown outer coat, lighter underneath than on his
      back and sides, and like Paddy he has a very warm soft under coat, through
      which the water cannot get and which keeps him comfortable, no matter how
      cold the water is. You have all seen his house in the Smiling Pool. He
      builds it in much the same way that Paddy builds his, but instead of
      sticks he cuts and uses rushes. Of course it is not nearly as large as
      Paddy's house, because Jerry is himself so much smaller. It is arranged
      much the same, with a comfortable bedroom and one or more passages down to
      deep water. In winter Jerry spends much of his time in this house, going
      out only for food. Then he lives chiefly on lily roots and roots of other
      water plants, digging them up and taking them back to his house to eat.
      When the ice is clear you can sometimes see him swimming below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; spoke up Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;Once I was crossing the Smiling Pool on
      the ice and saw him right under me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry doesn't build dams, but he sometimes digs little canals along the
      bottom where the water isn't deep enough to suit him,&rdquo; continued Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;Sometimes in the winter Jerry and Mrs. Jerry share their
      home with two or three friends. If there is a good bank Jerry usually has
      another home in that. He makes the entrance under water and then tunnels
      back and up for some distance, where he builds a snug little bedroom just
      below the surface of the ground where it is dry. Usually he has more than
      one tunnel leading to this, and sometimes an opening from above. This is
      covered with sticks and grass to hide it, and provides an entrance for
      fresh air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry lives mostly on roots and plants, but is fond of mussels or
      fresh-water clams, fish, some insects and, I am sorry to say, young birds
      when he can catch them. Jerry could explain where some of the babies of
      Mr. And Mrs. Quack the Ducks have disappeared to. Paddy the Beaver doesn't
      eat flesh at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry and Mrs. Jerry have several families in a year, and Jerry is a very
      good father, doing his share in caring for the babies. He and Mrs. Jerry
      are rather social and enjoy visiting neighbors of their own kind. Their
      voices are a sort of squeak, and you can often hear them talking among the
      rushes in the early evening. That is the hour they like best, though they
      are abroad during the day when undisturbed. Man is their greatest enemy.
      He hunts and traps them for their warm coats. But they have to watch out
      for Hooty the Owl at night and for Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote whenever
      they are on land. Billy Mink also is an enemy at times, perhaps the most
      to be dreaded because he can follow Jerry anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry makes little landings of mud and rushes along the edge of the
      shore. On these he delights to sit to eat his meals. He likes apples and
      vegetables and sometimes will travel quite a distance to get them. Late in
      the summer he begins to prepare for winter by starting work on his house,
      if he is to have a new one. He is a good worker. There isn't a lazy bone
      in him. All things considered, Jerry is a credit to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if Jerry is a credit to his family there is one of its members who is
      not and that is&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robber the Brown Rat,&rdquo; replied Happy Jack Squirrel promptly. &ldquo;I have
      often seen him around Farmer Brown's barn. Ugh! He is an ugly-looking
      fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is just as ugly as he looks,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;There
      isn't a good thing I can say for him, not one. He doesn't belong in this
      country at all. He was brought here by man, and now he is found
      everywhere. He is sometimes called the Norway Rat and sometimes the Wharf
      Rat and House Rat. He is hated by all animals and by man. He is big, being
      next in size to Jerry Muskrat, savage in temper, the most destructive of
      any animal I know, and dirty in his habits. He is an outcast, but he
      doesn't seem to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives chiefly around the homes of men, and all his food is stolen.
      That is why he is named Robber. He eats anything he can find and isn't the
      least bit particular what it is or whether it be clean or unclean. He
      gnaws into grain bins and steals the grain. He gets into hen-houses and
      sucks the eggs and kills young chickens. He would like nothing better than
      to find a nest of your babies, Peter Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shivered. &ldquo;I'm glad he sticks to the homes of men,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he doesn't,&rdquo; declared Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Often in summer he moves
      out into the fields, digging burrows there and doing great damage to crops
      and also killing and eating any of the furred and feathered folk he can
      catch. But he is not fond of the light of day. His deeds are deeds of
      darkness, and he prefers dark places. He has very large families,
      sometimes ten or more babies at a time, and several families in a year.
      That is why his tribe has managed to overrun the Great World and why they
      cause such great damage. Worse than the harm they do with their teeth is
      the terrible harm they do to man by carrying dreadful diseases and
      spreading them&mdash; diseases which cause people to die in great
      numbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't Robber afraid of any one?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly is,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is in deadly fear of one
      whom every one of you fears&mdash;Shadow the Weasel. One good thing I can
      say for Shadow is that he never misses a chance to kill a Rat. Wherever a
      Rat can go he can go, and once he finds a colony he hunts them until he
      has killed all or driven them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When food becomes scarce, Robber and his family move on to where it is
      more plentiful. Often they make long journeys, a great number of them
      together, and do not hesitate to swim a stream that may be in their path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never seen Robber,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;What kind of a tail does he have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known you would ask that,&rdquo; laughed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;It is
      long and slim and has no hair on it. His fur is very coarse and harsh and
      is brown and gray. He has a close relative called the Black Rat. But the
      latter is smaller and has been largely driven out of the country by his
      bigger cousin. Now I guess this is enough about Robber. He is bad, all
      bad, and hasn't a single friend in all the Great World.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a dreadful thing&mdash;not to have a single friend,&rdquo; said Happy
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dreadful, very dreadful,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;But it is
      wholly his own fault. It shows what happens when one becomes dishonest and
      bad at heart. The worst of it is Robber doesn't care. To-morrow I'll tell
      you about some of his cousins who are not bad.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV A Trader and a Handsome Fellow
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way down in the Sunny South,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;lives a member of
      the Rat family who, though not nearly so bad as Robber, is none too good
      and so isn't thought well of at all. He is Little Robber the Cotton Rat,
      and though small for a Rat, being only a trifle larger than Striped
      Chipmunk, looks the little savage that he is. He has short legs and is
      rather thick-bodied, and appears much like an overgrown Meadow Mouse with
      a long tail. The latter is not bare like Robber's, but the hair on it is
      very short and thin. In color he is yellowish-brown and whitish
      underneath. His fur is longer and coarser than that of other native Rats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives in old fields, along ditches and hedges, and in similar places
      where there is plenty of cover in which he can hide from his enemies. He
      burrows in the ground and usually has his nest of dry grass there, though
      often in summer it is the surface of the ground. He does not live in and
      around the homes of men, like the Brown Rat, but he causes a great deal of
      damage by stealing grain in the shock. He eats all kinds of grain, many
      seeds, and meat when he can get it. He is very destructive to eggs and
      young of ground-nesting birds. He has a bad temper and will fight
      savagely. Mr. and Mrs. Cotton Rat raise several large families in a year.
      Foxes, Owls and Hawks are their chief enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are other members of the Rat family far more interesting and
      quite worth knowing. One of these is Trader the Wood Rat, in some parts of
      the Far West called the Pack Rat. Among the mountains he is called the
      Mountain Rat. Wherever found, his habits are much the same and make him
      one of the most interesting of all the little people who wear fur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next to Jerry Muskrat he is the largest native Rat, that is, of the Rats
      which belong in this country. He is about two thirds as big as Robber the
      Brown Rat, but though he is of the same general shape, so that you would
      know at once that he is related to Robber, he is in all other ways wholly
      unlike that outcast. His fur is thick and soft, almost as soft as that of
      a Squirrel. His fairly long tail is covered with hair. Indeed, some
      members of his branch of the family have tails almost as bushy as a
      Squirrel's. His coat is soft gray and a yellowish-brown above, and
      underneath pure white or light buff. His feet are white. He has rounded
      ears and big black eyes with none of the ugliness in them that you always
      see in the eyes of Robber. And he has long whiskers and plenty of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is he called Trader?&rdquo; asked Rabbit a bit impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, Peter, patience. I'm coming to that,&rdquo; chided Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;He is Trader because his greatest delight is in trading. He is a born
      trader if ever there was one. He doesn't steal as other members of his
      family but trades. He puts something back in place of whatever he takes.
      It may be little sticks or chips or pebbles or anything else that is handy
      but it is something to replace what he has taken. You see, he is very
      honest. If Trader finds something belonging to some one else that he wants
      he takes it, but he tries to pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next to trading he delights in collecting. His home is a regular museum.
      He delights in anything bright and shiny. When he can get into the camps
      of men he will take anything he can move. But being honest, he tries to
      leave something in return. All sorts of queer things are found in his home&mdash;buckles
      cut from saddles, spoons, knives, forks, even money he has taken from the
      pockets of sleeping campers. Whenever any small object is missed from a
      camp, the first place visited in search of it is the home of Trader. In
      the mountains he sometimes makes piles of little pebbles just for the fun
      of collecting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is found all over the West, from the mountains to the deserts, in
      thick forests and on sandy wastes. He is also found in parts of the East
      and in the Sunny South. He is a great climber and is perfectly at home in
      trees or among rocks. He eats seeds, grain, many kinds of nuts, leaves and
      other parts of plants. In the colder sections he lays up stores for
      winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a home does he have?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His home usually is a very remarkable affair,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;It depends largely on where he is. When he is living in rocky country, he
      makes it amongst the rocks. In some places he burrows in the ground. But
      more often it is on the surface of the ground&mdash;a huge pile of sticks
      and thorns in the very middle of which is his snug, soft nest. The sticks
      and thorns are to protect it from enemies. When he lives down where cactus
      grow, those queer plants with long sharp spines, he uses these, and there
      are few enemies who will try to pull one of these houses apart to get at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is alarmed or disturbed, he has a funny habit of drumming on the
      ground with his hind feet in much the same way that Peter Rabbit and
      Jumper the Hare thump, only he does it rapidly. Sometimes he builds his
      house in a tree. When he finds a cabin in the woods he at once takes
      possession, carrying in a great mass of sticks and trash. He is chiefly
      active at night, and a very busy fellow he is, trading and collecting. He
      has none of the mean disposition of Robber the Brown Rat. Mrs. Trader has
      two to five babies at a time and raises several families in a year. As I
      said before, Trader is one of the most interesting little people I know
      of, and he does very, very funny things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we come to the handsomest member of the family, Longfoot the Kangaroo
      Rat, so called because of his long hind legs and tail and the way in which
      he sits up and jumps. Really he is not a member of the Rat branch of the
      family, but closely related to the Pocket Mice. You see, he has pockets in
      his cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like mine?&rdquo; asked Striped Chipmunk quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are on the outside instead of the inside of his cheeks. Yours
      are inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think mine must be a lot handier,&rdquo; asserted Striped Chipmunk, nodding
      his head in a very decided way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longfoot seems to think his are quite satisfactory,&rdquo; replied Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;He really is handsome, but he isn't a bit vain and is very
      gentle. He never tries to bite when caught and taken in a man's hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't told us how big he is or what he looks like,&rdquo; protested
      impatient Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he sits up or jumps he looks like a tiny Kangaroo. But that doesn't
      mean anything to you, and you are no wiser than before, for you never have
      seen a Kangaroo,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;In the first place he is
      about the size of Striped Chipmunk. That is, his body is about the size of
      Striped Chipmunk's; but his tail is longer than his head and body
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, it must be some tail!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You would like that tail,
      Peter. His front legs are short and the feet small, but his hind legs are
      long and the feet big. Of course you have seen Nimbleheels the Jumping
      Mouse, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;My how that fellow can jump!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Longfoot is built on the same plan as Nimbleheels and for the same
      purpose,&rdquo; continued Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is a jumper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I know what that long tail is for,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;It is to keep him
      balanced when he is in the air so that he can jump straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right again, Peter,&rdquo; laughed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;That is just what it is
      for. Without it, he never would know where he was going to land when he
      jumped. As I told you, he is a handsome little fellow. His fur is very
      soft and silky. Above, it is a pretty yellowish-brown, but underneath it
      is pure white. His cheeks are brown, he is white around the ears, and a
      white stripe crosses his hips and keeps right on along the sides of his
      tail. The upper and under parts of his tail are almost or quite black, and
      the tail ends in a tuft of long hair which is pure white. His feet are
      also white. His head is rather large for his size, and long. He has a long
      nose. Longfoot has a number of cousins, some of them much smaller than he,
      but they all look very much alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do they live?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck, for Johnny had been unable to
      stay away from school another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dry, sandy parts of the Southwest, places so dry that it seldom
      rains, and water is to be found only long distances apart,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how does Longfoot get water to drink?&rdquo; demanded Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gets along without drinking,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Such
      moisture as he needs he gets from his food. He eats seeds, leaves of
      certain plants and tender young plants just coming up. He burrows in the
      ground and throws up large mounds of earth. These have several entrances.
      One of these is the main entrance, and during the day this is often kept
      closed with earth. Under the mound he has little tunnels in all
      directions, a snug little bedroom and storerooms for food. He is very
      industrious and dearly loves to dig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longfoot likes to visit his relatives sometimes, and where there are
      several families living near together, little paths lead from mound to
      mound. He comes out mostly at night, probably because he feels it to be
      safer then. Then, too, in that hot country it is cooler at night. The dusk
      of early evening is his favorite playtime. If Longfoot has a quarrel with
      one of his relatives they fight, hopping about each other, watching for a
      chance to leap and kick with those long, strong hind feet. Longfoot
      sometimes drums with his hind feet after the manner of Trader the Wood
      Rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think this will do for this morning. If any of you should meet
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, tell him to come to school to-morrow morning.
      And you might tell Danny Meadow if you little folks want school to
      continue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do!&rdquo; cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Happy Jack Squirrel
      and Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Striped Chipmunk and Johnny Chuck as
      one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV Two Unlike Little Cousins
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse is one of the smallest of the little people who
      live in the Green Forest. Being so small he is one of the most timid. You
      see, by day and by night sharp eyes are watching for Whitefoot and he
      knows it. Never one single instant, while he is outside where sharp eyes
      of hungry enemies may see him, does he forget that they are watching for
      him. To forget even for one little minute might mean&mdash;well, it might
      mean the end of little Whitefoot, but a dinner for some one with a liking
      for tender Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Whitefoot the Wood Mouse rarely ventures more than a few feet from a
      hiding place and safety. At the tiniest sound he starts nervously and
      often darts back into hiding without waiting to find out if there really
      is any danger. If he waited to make sure he might wait too long, and it is
      better to be safe than sorry. If you and I had as many real frights in a
      year, not to mention false frights, as Whitefoot has in a day, we would, I
      suspect, lose our minds. Certainly we would be the most unhappy people in
      all the Great World.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Whitefoot isn't unhappy. Not a bit of it. He is a very happy little
      fellow. There is a great deal of wisdom in that pretty little head of his.
      There is more real sense in it than in some very big heads. When some of
      his neighbors make fun of him for being so very, very timid he doesn't try
      to pretend that he isn't afraid. He doesn't get angry. He simply says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm timid, very timid indeed. I'm afraid of almost everything.
      I would be foolish not to be. It is because I am afraid that I am alive
      and happy right now. I hope I shall never be less timid than I am now, for
      it would mean that sooner or later I would fail to run in time and would
      be gobbled up. It isn't cowardly to be timid when there is danger all
      around. Nor is it bravery to take a foolish and needless risk. So I seldom
      go far from home. It isn't safe for me, and I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This being the way Whitefoot looked at matters, you can guess how he felt
      when Chatterer the Red Squirrel caught sight of him and gave him Old
      Mother Nature's message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi there, Mr. Fraidy!&rdquo; shouted Chatterer, as he caught sight of Whitefoot
      darting under a log. &ldquo;Hi there! I've got a message for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, cautiously, Whitefoot poked his head out from beneath the old log
      and looked up at Chatterer. &ldquo;What kind of a message?&rdquo; he demanded
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A message you'll do well to heed. It is from Old Mother Nature,&rdquo; replied
      Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A message from Old Mother Nature!&rdquo; cried Whitefoot, and came out a bit
      more from beneath the old log.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said, a message from Old Mother Nature, and if you will
      take my advice you will heed it,&rdquo; retorted Chatterer. &ldquo;She says you are to
      come to school with the rest of us at sun-up to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Chatterer explained about the school and where it was held each
      morning and what a lot he and his friends had already learned there.
      Whitefoot listened with something very like dismay in his heart. That
      place where school was held was a long way off. That is, it was a long way
      for him, though to Peter Rabbit or Jumper the Hare it wouldn't have seemed
      long at all. It meant that he would have to leave all his hiding places
      and the thought made him shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Old Mother Nature had sent for him and not once did he even think of
      disobeying. &ldquo;Did you say that school begins at sun-up?&rdquo; he asked, and when
      Chatterer nodded Whitefoot sighed. It was a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I'm glad of
      that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can travel in the night, which will be much safer. I'll
      be there. That is, I will if I am not caught on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile over on the Green Meadows Peter Rabbit was looking for Danny
      Meadow Mouse. Danny's home was not far from the dear Old Briar-patch, and
      he and Peter were and still are very good friends. So Peter knew just
      about where to look for Danny and it didn't take him long to find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Peter! You look as if you have something very important on your
      mind,&rdquo; was the greeting of Danny Meadow Mouse as Peter came hurrying up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;It is a message for you. Old Mother Nature says for
      you to be on hand at sun-up to-morrow when school opens over in the Green
      Forest. Of course you will be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Danny in the most matter-of-fact tone. &ldquo;Of course. If
      Old Mother Nature really sent me that message&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She really did,&rdquo; interrupted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't anything for me to do but obey,&rdquo; finished Danny. Then his
      face became very sober. &ldquo;That is a long way for me to go, Peter,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;I wouldn't take such a long journey for anything or for anybody else. Old
      Mother Nature knows, and if she sent for me she must be sure I can make
      the trip safely. What time did you say I must be there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At sun-up,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Shall I call for you on my way there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danny shook his head. Then he began to laugh. &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
       demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the very idea of me with my short legs trying to keep up with you,&rdquo;
       replied Danny. &ldquo;I wish you would sit up and take a good look all around to
      make sure that Old Man Coyote and Reddy Fox and Redtail the Hawk and Black
      Pussy, that pesky Cat from Farmer Brown's, are nowhere about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter obligingly sat up and looked this way and looked that way and looked
      the other way. No one of whom he or Danny Meadow Mouse need be afraid was
      to be seen. He said as much, then asked, &ldquo;Why did you want to know,
      Danny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am going to start at once,&rdquo; replied Danny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start for where?&rdquo; asked Peter, looking much puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start for school of course,&rdquo; replied Danny rather shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But school doesn't begin until sun-up to-morrow,&rdquo; protested Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is just the reason I am going to start now,&rdquo; retorted Danny. &ldquo;If I
      should put off starting until the last minute I might not get there at
      all. I would have to hurry, and it is difficult to hurry and watch for
      danger at the same time. I've noticed that people who put things off to
      the last minute and then have to hurry are quite apt to rush headlong into
      trouble. The way is clear now, so I am going to start. I can take my time
      and keep a proper watch for danger. I'll see you over there in the
      morning, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danny turned and disappeared in one of his private little paths though the
      tall grass. Peter noticed that he was headed towards the Green Forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter and the others arrived for school the next morning they found
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse waiting with Old Mother
      Nature. Safe in her presence, they seemed to have lost much of their usual
      timidity. Whitefoot was sitting on the end of a log and Danny was on the
      ground just beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want all the rest of you to look well at these two little cousins and
      notice how unlike two cousins can be,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Whitefoot,
      who is quite as often called Deer Mouse as Wood Mouse, is one of the
      prettiest of the entire Mouse family. I suspect he is called Deer Mouse
      because the upper part of his coat is such a beautiful fawn color. Notice
      that the upper side of his long slim tail is of the same color, while the
      under side is white, as is the whole under part of Whitefoot. Also those
      dainty feet are white, hence his name. See what big, soft black eyes he
      has, and notice that those delicate ears are of good size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His tail is covered with short fine hairs, instead of being naked as is
      the tail of Nibbler the House mouse, of whom I will tell you later.
      Whitefoot loves the Green Forest, but out in parts of the Far West where
      there is no Green Forest he lives on the brushy plains. He is a good
      climber and quite at home in the trees. There he seems almost like a tiny
      Squirrel. Tell us, Whitefoot, where you make your home and what you eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My home just now,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot, &ldquo;is in a certain hollow in a
      certain dead limb of a certain tree. I suspect that a member of the
      Woodpecker family made that hollow, but no one was living there when I
      found it. Mrs. Whitefoot and I have made a soft, warm nest there and
      wouldn't trade homes with any one. We have had our home in a hollow log on
      the ground, in an old stump, in a hole we dug in the ground under a rock,
      and in an old nest of some bird. That was in a tall bush. We roofed that
      nest over and make a little round doorway on the under side. Once we
      raised a family in a box in a dark corner of Farmer Brown's sugar camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I eat all sorts of things&mdash;seeds, nuts, insects and meat when I can
      get it. I store up food for winter, as all wise and thrifty people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that means that you do not sleep as Johnny Chuck does in
      winter,&rdquo; remarked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitefoot. &ldquo;I like winter. It is fun to run
      about on the snow. Haven't you ever seen my tracks, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, lots of times,&rdquo; spoke up Jumper the Hare. &ldquo;Also I've seen you
      skipping about after dark. I guess you don't care much for sunlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot. &ldquo;I sleep most of the time during the day,
      and work and play at night. I feel safer then. But on dull days I often
      come out. It is the bright sunlight I don't like. That is one reason I
      stick to the Green Forest. I don't see how Cousin Danny stands it out
      there on the Green Meadows. Now I guess it is his turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every one looked at Danny Meadow Mouse. In appearance he was as unlike
      Whitefoot as it was possible to be and still be a Mouse. There was nothing
      pretty or graceful about Danny. He wasn't dainty at all. His body was
      rather stout, looking stouter than it really was because his fur was quite
      long. His head was blunt, and he seemed to have no neck at all, though of
      course he did have one. His eyes were small, like little black beads. His
      ears were almost hidden in his hair. His legs were short and his tail was
      quite short, as if it had been cut off when half grown. No, those two
      cousins didn't look a bit alike. Danny felt most uncomfortable as the
      others compared him with pretty Whitefoot. He knew he was homely, but
      never before had he felt it quite so keenly. Old Mother Nature saw and
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't how we look, but what we are and what we do and how we fit into
      our particular places in life that count,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Now, Danny is a
      homely little fellow, but I know, and I know that he knows that he is just
      fitted for the life he lives, and he lives it more successfully for being
      just as he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danny is a lover of the fields and meadows where there is little else but
      grass in which to hide. Everything about him is just suited for living
      there. Isn't that so, Danny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I guess so,&rdquo; replied Danny. &ldquo;Sometimes my tail does seem
      dreadfully short to look well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody laughed, even Danny himself. Then he remembered how once Reddy
      Fox had so nearly caught him that one of Reddy's black paws had touched
      the tip of his tail. Had that tail been any longer Reddy would have caught
      him by it. Danny's face cleared and he hastened to declare, &ldquo;After all, my
      tail suits me just as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisely spoken, Danny,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now it is your turn to
      tell how you live and what you eat and anything else of interest about
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there isn't much interesting about me,&rdquo; began Danny modestly.
      &ldquo;I'm just one of the plain, common little folks. I guess everybody knows
      me so well there is nothing for me to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them may know all about you, but I don't,&rdquo; declared Jumper the
      Hare. &ldquo;I never go out on the Green Meadows where you live. How do you get
      about in all that tall grass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's easy enough,&rdquo; replied Danny. &ldquo;I cut little paths in all
      directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the way I do in the dear Old Briar-patch,&rdquo; interrupted Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep those little paths clear and clean so that there never is anything
      in my way to trip me up when I have to run for safety,&rdquo; continued Danny.
      &ldquo;When the grass gets tall those little paths are almost like little
      tunnels. The time I dread most is when Farmer Brown cuts the grass for
      hay. I not only have to watch out for that dreadful mowing machine, but
      when the hay has been taken away the grass is so short that it is hard
      work for me to keep out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes dig a short burrow and at the end of it make a nice nest of
      dry grass. Sometimes in summer Mrs. Danny and I make our nest on the
      surface of the ground in a hollow or in a clump of tall grass, especially
      if the ground is low and wet. We have several good-sized families in a
      year. All Meadow Mice believe in large families, and that is probably why
      there are more Meadow Mice than any other Mice in the country. I forgot to
      say that I am also called Field Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is because there are so many of your family and they require so
      much to eat that you do a great deal of damage to grass and other crops,&rdquo;
       spoke up Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she explained to the others, &ldquo;Danny
      eats grass, clover, bulbs, roots, seeds and garden vegetables. He also
      eats some insects. He sometimes puts away a few seeds for the winter, but
      depends chiefly on finding enough to eat, for he is active all winter. He
      tunnels about under the snow in search of food. When other food is hard to
      find he eats bark, and then he sometimes does great damage in young
      orchards. He gnaws the bark from young fruit trees all the way around as
      high as he can reach, and of course this kills the trees. He is worse than
      Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danny didn't mention that he is a good swimmer and not at all afraid of
      the water. No one has more enemies than he, and the fact that he is alive
      and here at school this morning is due to his everlasting watchfulness.
      This will do for to-day. To-morrow we will take up others of the Mouse
      family.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI Danny's Northern Cousins and Nimbleheels
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse had become so interested
      that they decided they couldn't afford to miss the next lesson. Neither
      did either of them feel like making the long journey to his home and back
      again. So Whitefoot found a hole in a stump near by and decided to camp
      out there for a few days. Danny decided to do the same thing in a
      comfortable place under a pile of brush not far away. So the next morning
      both were on hand when school opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you yesterday that I would tell you about some of Danny's
      cousins,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature just as Chatterer the Red Squirrel, who
      was late, came hurrying up quite out of breath. &ldquo;Way up in the Far North
      are two of Danny's cousins more closely related to him than to any other
      members of the Mouse family. Yet, strange to say, they are not called Mice
      at all, but Lemmings. However, they belong to the Mouse family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bandy the Banded Lemming is the most interesting, because he is the one
      member of the entire family who changes the color of his coat. In summer
      he wears beautiful shades of reddish brown and gray, but in winter his
      coat is wholly white. He is also called the Hudson Bay Lemming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Danny Meadow Mouse thinks his tail is short, but he wouldn't if he should
      see Bandy's tail. That is so short it hardly shows beyond his long fur. He
      is about Danny's size, but a little stouter and stockier, and his long fur
      makes him appear even thicker-bodied than he really is. He has very short
      legs, and his ears are so small that they are quite hidden in the fur
      around them, so that he appears to have no ears at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that same far northern country is a close relative called the Brown
      Lemming. He is very much like Bandy save that he is all brown and does not
      change his coat in winter. Both have the same general habits, and these
      are much like the habits of Danny Meadow Mouse. They make short burrows in
      the ground leading to snug, warm nests of grass and moss. In winter they
      make little tunnels in every direction under the snow, with now and then
      an opening to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are many more Brown Lemmings than Banded Lemmings, and their little
      paths run everywhere through the grass and moss. In that country there is
      a great deal of moss. It covers the ground just as grass does here. But
      the most interesting thing about these Lemmings is the way they migrate.
      To migrate is to move from one part of the country to another. You know
      most of the birds migrate to the Sunny South every autumn and back every
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once in a while it happens that food becomes very scarce where the
      Lemmings are. Then very many of them get together, just as migrating birds
      form great flocks, and start on a long journey in search of a place where
      there is plenty of food. They form a great army and push ahead, regardless
      of everything. They swim wide rivers and even lakes which may lie in their
      way. Of course, they eat everything eatable in their path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Danny Meadow Mouse, &ldquo;I'm glad I don't live in a country
      where I might have to make such long journeys. I don't envy those cousins
      up there in the Far North a bit. I'm perfectly satisfied to live right on
      the Green Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which shows your good common sense,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;By the way,
      Danny, I suppose you are acquainted with Nimbleheels the Jumping Mouse,
      who also is rather fond of the Green Meadows. I ought to have sent word to
      him to be here this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words out of Old Mother Nature's mouth when something
      landed in the leaves almost at her feet and right in the middle of school.
      Instantly Danny Meadow Mouse scurried under a pile of dead leaves.
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse darted into a knothole in the log on which he had
      been sitting. Jumper the Hare dodged behind a little hemlock tree. Peter
      Rabbit bolted for a hollow log. Striped Chipmunk vanished in a hole under
      an old stump. Johnny Chuck backed up against the trunk of a tree and made
      ready to fight. Only Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel and Prickly Porky the Porcupine, who were sitting in trees, kept
      their places. You see they felt quite safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as all those who had run had reached places of safety, they peeped
      out to see what had frightened them so. Just imagine how very, very
      foolish they felt when they saw Old Mother Nature smiling down at a little
      fellow just about the size of little Whitefoot, but with a much longer
      tail. It was Nimbleheels the Jumping Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; exclaimed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;I was just speaking of
      you and wishing I had you here. How did you happen to come? And what do
      you mean by scaring my pupils half out of their wits?&rdquo; Her eyes twinkled.
      Nimbleheels saw this and knew that she was only pretending to be severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he could reply Johnny Chuck began to chuckle. The chuckle became a
      laugh, and presently Johnny was laughing so hard he had to hold his sides.
      Now, as you know, laughter is catching. In a minute or so everybody was
      laughing, and no one but Johnny Chuck knew what the joke was. At last
      Peter Rabbit stopped laughing long enough to ask Johnny what he was
      laughing at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the idea of that little pinch of nothing giving us all such a fright,&rdquo;
       replied Johnny Chuck. Then all laughed some more.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were through laughing Nimbleheels answered Old Mother Nature's
      questions. He explained that he had heard about that school, as by this
      time almost every one in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows had. By
      chance he learned that Danny Meadow Mouse was attending. He thought that
      if it was a good thing for Danny it would be a good thing for him, so he
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I was almost here I heard a twig snap behind me, or thought I
      did, and I jumped so as to get here and be safe. I didn't suppose anyone
      would be frightened by little me,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It was some jump!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Jumper the Hare admiringly. &ldquo;He went right over my head, and I
      was sitting up at that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't much of a jump to go over your head,&rdquo; replied Nimbleheels. &ldquo;You
      ought to see me when I really try to jump. I wasn't half trying when I
      landed here. I'm sorry I frightened all of you so. It gives me a queer
      feeling just to think that I should be able to frighten anybody. If you
      please, Mother Nature, am I in time for to-day's lesson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for all of it, but you are just in time for the part I wanted you
      here for,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Hop up on that log side of your
      Cousin Whitefoot, where all can see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nimbleheels hopped up beside Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, and as the two
      little cousins sat side by side they were not unlike in general
      appearance, though of the two Whitefoot was the prettier. The coat of
      Nimbleheels was a dull yellowish, darker on the back than on the sides.
      Like Whitefoot he was white underneath. His ears were much smaller than
      those of Whitefoot. But the greatest differences between the two were in
      their hind legs and tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hind legs and feet of Nimbleheels were long, on the same plan as those
      of Peter Rabbit. From just a glance at them any one would know that he was
      a born jumper and a good one. Whitefoot possessed a long tail, but the
      tail of Nimbleheels was much longer, slim and tapering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;is the greatest jumper for his size
      among all the animals in this great country. When I say this, I mean the
      greatest ground jumper. Timmy the Flying Squirrel jumps farther, but Timmy
      has to climb to a high place and then coasts down on the air. I told you
      what wonderful jumps Jack Rabbit can make, but if he could jump as high
      and far for his size as Nimbleheels can jump for his size, the longest
      jump Jack has ever made would seem nothing more than a hop. By the way,
      both Nimbleheels and Whitefoot have small pockets in their cheeks. Tell us
      where you live, Nimbleheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live among the weeds along the edge of the Green Meadows,&rdquo; replied
      Nimbleheels, &ldquo;though sometimes I go way out on the Green Meadows. But I
      like best to be among the weeds because they are tall and keep me well
      hidden, and also because they furnish me plenty to eat. You see, I live
      largely on seeds, though I am also fond of berries and small nuts,
      especially beechnuts. Some of my family prefer the Green Forest,
      especially if there is a Laughing Brook or pond in it. Personally I
      prefer, as I said before, the edge of the Green Meadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you make your home under the ground?&rdquo; asked Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For winter, yes,&rdquo; replied Nimbleheels. &ldquo;In summer I sometimes put my nest
      just a few inches under ground, but often I hide it under a piece of bark
      or in a thick clump of grass, just as Danny Meadow Mouse often does his.
      In the fall I dig a deep burrow, deep enough to be beyond the reach of
      Jack Frost, and in a nice little bedroom down there I sleep the winter
      away. I have little storerooms down there too, in which I put seeds,
      berries and nuts. Then when I do wake up I have plenty to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might add,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;that when he goes to sleep for the
      winter he curls up in a little ball with his long tail wrapped around him,
      and in his bed of soft grass he sleeps very sound indeed. Like Johnny
      Chuck he gets very fat before going to sleep. Now, Nimbleheels, show us
      how you can jump.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nimbleheels hopped down from the log on which he had been sitting and at
      once shot into the air in such a high, long, beautiful jump that everybody
      exclaimed. This way and that way he went in great leaps. It was truly
      wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That long tail is what balances him,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;If he
      should lose it he would simply turn over and over and never know where or
      how he was going to land. His jumping is done only in times of danger.
      When he is not alarmed he runs about on the ground like the rest of the
      Mouse family. This is all for to-day. To-morrow I will tell you still more
      about the Mouse family.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII Three Little Redcoats and Some Others
    </h2>
    <p>
      With Whitefoot the Wood Mouse, Danny Meadow Mouse and Nimbleheels the
      Jumping Mouse attending school, the Mouse family was well represented, but
      when school opened the morning after Nimbleheels had made his sudden and
      startling appearance, there was still another present. It was Piney the
      Pine Mouse. Whitefoot, who knew him, had hunted him up and brought him
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you wouldn't mind if Piney came,&rdquo; explained Whitefoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad he has come,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;It is much better to
      see a thing than merely to be told about it, and now you have a chance to
      see for yourselves the differences between two cousins very closely
      related, Danny Meadow Mouse and Piney the Pine Mouse. What difference do
      you see, Happy Jack Squirrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piney is a little smaller than Danny, though he is much the same shape,&rdquo;
       was the prompt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now, Striped Chipmunk, what difference do
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fur of Piney's coat is shorter, finer and has more of a shine. Then,
      too, it is more of a reddish-brown than Danny's,&rdquo; replied Striped
      Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you say, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Piney has a shorter tail,&rdquo; declared Peter, and everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trust you to look at his tail first,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;These are
      the chief differences as far as looks are concerned. Their habits differ
      in about the same degree. As you all know, Danny cuts little paths through
      the grass. Piney doesn't do this, but makes little tunnels just under the
      surface of the ground very much as Miner the Mole does. He isn't fond of
      the open Green Meadows or of damp places as Danny is, but likes best the
      edge of the Green Forest and brushy places. He is very much at home in a
      poorly kept orchard where the weeds are allowed to grow and in young
      orchards he does a great deal of damage by cutting off the roots of young
      trees and stripping off the bark as high up as he can reach. Tell us,
      Piney, how and where you make your home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Piney hesitated a little, for he was bashful. &ldquo;I make my home under
      ground,&rdquo; he ventured finally. &ldquo;I dig a nice little bedroom with several
      entrances from my tunnels, and in it I make a fine nest of soft grass.
      Close by I dig one or more rooms in which to store my food, and these
      usually are bigger than my bedroom. When I get one filled with food I
      close it up by filling the entrance with earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you put in your storerooms?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Short pieces of grass and pieces of roots of different kinds,&rdquo; replied
      Piney. &ldquo;I am very fond of tender roots and the bark of trees and bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he dearly loves to get in a garden where he can tunnel along a row of
      potatoes or other root crops,&rdquo; added Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Because of these
      habits he does a great deal of damage and is much disliked by man. Striped
      Chipmunk mentioned his reddish-brown coat. There is another cousin with a
      coat so red that he is called the Red-backed Mouse. He is about the size
      of Danny Meadow Mouse but has larger ears and a longer tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This little fellow is a lover of the Green Forest, and he is quite as
      active by day as by night. He is pretty, especially when he sits up to
      eat, holding his food in his paws as does Happy Jack Squirrel. He makes
      his home in a burrow, the entrance to which is under an old stump, a rock
      or the root of a tree. His nest is of soft grass or moss. Sometimes he
      makes it in a hollow log or stump instead of digging a bedroom under
      ground. He is thrifty and lays up a supply of food in underground rooms,
      hollow logs and similar places. He eats seeds, small fruits, roots and
      various plants. Because of his preference for the Green Forest and the
      fact that he lives as a rule far from the homes of men, he does little
      real damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is still another little Redcoat in the family, and he is especially
      interesting because while he is related to Danny Meadow Mouse he lives
      almost wholly in trees. He is called the Rufous Tree Mouse. Rufous means
      reddish-brown, and he gets that name because of the color of his coat. He
      lives in the great forests of the Far West, where the trees are so big and
      tall that the biggest tree you have ever seen would look small beside
      them. And it is in those great trees that the Rufous Tree Mouse lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just why he took to living in trees no one knows, for he belongs to that
      branch of the family known as Ground Mice. But live in them he does, and
      he is quite as much at home in them as any Squirrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chatterer the Red Squirrel was interested right away. &ldquo;Does he build a
      nest in a tree like a Squirrel?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly does,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;and often it is a most
      remarkable nest. In some sections he places it only in big trees,
      sometimes a hundred feet from the ground. In other sections it is placed
      in small trees and only a few feet above the ground. The high nests often
      are old deserted nests of Squirrels enlarged and built over. Some of them
      are very large indeed and have been used year after year. Each year they
      have been added to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of these big nests will have several bedrooms and little passages
      running all through it. It appears that Mrs. Rufous usually has one of
      these big nests to herself, Rufous having a small nest of his own out on
      one of the branches. The big nest is close up against the trunk of the
      tree where several branches meet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Rufous travel from one tree to another, or does he live in just one
      tree?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever branches of one tree touch those of another, and you know in a
      thick forest this is frequently the case, he travels about freely if he
      wants to. But those trees are so big that I suspect he spends most of his
      time in the one in which his home is,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;However, if an enemy appears in his home tree, he makes his escape by
      jumping from one tree to another, just as you would do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I want to know is where he gets his food if he spends all his time
      up in the trees,&rdquo; spoke up Danny Meadow Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;Where should he get it but up where he lives?&rdquo;
       she asked. &ldquo;Rufous never has to worry about food. It is all around him.
      You see, so far as known, he lives wholly on the thick parts of the
      needles, which you know are the leaves, of fir and spruce trees, and on
      the bark of tender twigs. So you see he is more of a tree dweller than any
      of the Squirrel family. While Rufous has the general shape of Danny and
      his relatives, he has quite a long tail. Now I guess this will do for the
      nearest relatives of Danny Meadow Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly has a lot of them,&rdquo; remarked Whitefoot the Wood Mouse. Then
      he added a little wistfully, &ldquo;Of course, in a way they are all cousins of
      mine, but I wish I had some a little more closely related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, and Whitefoot pricked up his big
      ears. &ldquo;One of them Bigear the Rock Mouse, who lives out in the mountains
      of the Far West. He is as fond of the rocks as Rufous is of the trees.
      Sometimes he lives in brush heaps and in brushy country, but he prefers
      rocks, and that is why he is known as the Rock Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a pretty little fellow, if anything a trifle bigger than you,
      Whitefoot, and he is dressed much like you with a yellowish-brown coat and
      white waistcoat. He has just such a long tail covered with hair its whole
      length. But you should see his ears. He has the largest ears of any member
      of the whole family. That is why he is called Bigear. He likes best to be
      out at night, but often comes out on dull days. He eats seeds and small
      nuts and is especially fond of juniper seeds. He always lays up a supply
      of food for winter. Often he is found very high up on the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another of your cousins, Whitefoot, lives along the seashore of the East
      down in the Sunny South. He is called the Beach Mouse. In general
      appearance he is much like you, having the same shape, long tail and big
      ears, but he is a little smaller and his coat varies. When he lives back
      from the shore, in fields where the soil is dark, his upper coat is dark
      grayish-brown, but when he lives on the white sands of the seashore it is
      very light. His home is in short burrows in the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you little people think you have learned enough about the Mouse
      family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't told us about Nibbler the House Mouse yet. And you said you
      would,&rdquo; protested Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when we were learning about Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat you said he was
      most closely related to the Pocket Mice. What about them?&rdquo; said Johnny
      Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that you want to know all
      there is to know. Be on hand to-morrow morning. I guess we can finish up
      with the Mouse family then and with them the order of Rodents to which all
      of you belong.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII Mice with Pockets, and Others
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pockets are very handy things for little people who are thrifty and who
      live largely on small seeds. Without pockets in which to carry the seeds,
      I am afraid some of them would never be able to store up enough food for
      winter,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, as soon as everybody was on hand the
      next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be without my pockets for any thing,&rdquo; spoke up Striped
      Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;You certainly do make good use of yours,&rdquo; said
      she. &ldquo;But there are others who have even greater need of pockets, and
      among them are the Pocket Mice. Of course, it is because of their pockets
      that they are called Pocket Mice. All of these pretty little fellows live
      in the dry parts of the Far West and Southwest in the same region where
      Longfoot the Kangaroo Rat lives. They are close neighbors and relatives of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Midget the Silky Pocket Mouse is one of the smallest animals in all the
      Great World, so small that Whitefoot the Wood Mouse is a giant compared
      with him. He weighs less than an ounce and is a dear little fellow. His
      back and sides are yellow, and beneath he is white. He has quite long hind
      legs and a long tail, and these show at once that he is a jumper. In each
      cheek is a pocket opening from the outside, and these pockets are lined
      with hair. He is called Silky Pocket Mouse because of the fineness and
      softness of his coat. He has some larger cousins, one of them being a
      little bigger than Nibbler the House Mouse. Neighbors and close relatives
      are the Spiny Pocket Mice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they have spines like Prickly Porky?&rdquo; demanded Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;I don't wonder you ask,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I think it
      is a foolish name myself, for they haven't any spines at all. Their fur
      isn't as fine as that of Midget, and it has all through it long coarse
      hairs almost like bristles, and from these they get their name. The
      smallest of the Spiny Pocket Mice is about the size of Nibbler the House
      Mouse and the largest is twice as big. They are more slender than their
      Silky cousins, and their tails are longer in proportion to their size and
      have little tufts of hair at the ends. Of course, they have pockets in
      their cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In habits all the Pocket Mice are much alike. They make burrows in the
      ground, often throwing up a little mound with several entrances which lead
      to a central passageway connecting with the bedroom and storerooms. By day
      the entrances are closed with earth from inside, for the Mice are active
      only at night. Sometimes the burrows are hidden under bushes, and
      sometimes they are right out in the open. Living as they do in a hot, dry
      country, the Pocket Mice have learned to get along without drinking water.
      Their food consists mainly of a variety of small seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another Mouse of the West looks almost enough like Whitefoot to be a
      member of his branch of the family. He has a beautiful yellowish-brown
      coat and white waistcoat, and his feet are white. But his tail is short in
      comparison with Whitefoot's and instead of being slim is quite thick. His
      fur is like velvet. He is called the Grasshopper Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that because he eats Grasshoppers?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've guessed it,&rdquo; laughed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is very, very fond of
      Grasshoppers and Crickets. He eats many kinds of insects, Moths, Flies,
      Cutworms, Beetles, Lizards, Frogs and Scorpions. Because of his fondness
      for the latter he is called the Scorpion Mouse in some sections. He is
      fond of meat when he can get it. He also eats seeds of many kinds. He is
      found all over the West from well up in the North to the hot dry regions
      of the Southwest. When he cannot find a convenient deserted burrow of some
      other animal, he digs a home for himself and there raises several families
      each year. In the early evening he often utters a fine, shrill, whistling
      call note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another little member of the Mouse family found clear across the country
      is the Harvest Mouse. He is never bigger than Nibbler the House Mouse and
      often is much smaller. In fact, he is one of the smallest of the entire
      family. In appearance he is much like Nibbler, but his coat is browner and
      there are fine hairs on his tail. He loves grassy, weedy or brushy places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a rule he does little harm to man, for his food is chiefly seeds of
      weeds, small wild fruits and parts of wild plants of no value to man. Once
      in a while his family becomes so large that they do some damage in grain
      fields. But this does not happen often. The most interesting thing about
      this little Mouse is the way he builds his home. Sometimes he uses a hole
      in a tree or post and sometimes a deserted birds' nest, but more
      frequently he builds a nest for himself&mdash;a little round ball of grass
      and other vegetable matter. This is placed in thick grass or weeds close
      to the ground or in bushes or low trees several feet from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are well-built little houses and have one or more little doorways on
      the under side when they are in bushes or trees. Inside is a warm, soft
      bed made of milkweed or cattail down, the very nicest kind of a bed for
      the babies. No one has a neater home than the Harvest Mouse. He is quite
      as much at home in bushes and low trees as Happy Jack Squirrel is in
      bigger trees. His long tail comes in very handy then, for he often wraps
      it around a twig to make his footing more secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this is all about the native Mice and&mdash;what is it, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've forgotten Nibbler the House Mouse,&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How impatient some little folks are and how fearful that their curiosity
      will not be satisfied,&rdquo; remarked Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;As I was saying, this
      is all about our native Mice; that is, the Mice who belong to this
      country. And now we come to Nibbler the House Mouse, who, like Robber the
      Brown Rat, has no business here at all, but who has followed man all over
      the world and like Robber has become a pest to man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit looked rather sheepish when he discovered that Old Mother
      Nature hadn't for gotten, and resolved that in the future he would hold
      his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have any of you seen Nibbler?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Danny Meadow Mouse. &ldquo;Once I was carried to Farmer
      Brown's barn in a shock of corn and I found Nibbler living in the barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a wonder he wasn't living in Farmer Brown's house,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;Probably other members of his family were. He is perfectly at
      home in any building put up by man, just as is Robber the Rat. Because of
      his small size he can go where Robber cannot. He delights to scamper about
      between the walls. Being a true Rodent he is forever gnawing holes in the
      corners of rooms and opening on to pantry shelves so that he may steal
      food. He eats all sorts of food, but spoils more for man, by running about
      over it, than he eats. In barns and henhouses he gets into the grain bins
      and steals a great deal of grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is largely because of Robber the Rat and Nibbler that men keep the
      Cats you all hate so. A Cat is Nibbler's worst enemy. Nibbler is slender
      and graceful, with a long, hairless tail and ears of good size. He is very
      timid, ready to dart into his hole at the least sound. He raises from four
      to nine babies at a time and several sets of them in a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. and Mrs. Nibbler are living in a house, their nest is made of
      scraps of paper, cloth, wool and other soft things stolen from the people
      who live in the house. In getting this material they often do great
      damage. If they are living in a barn, they make their nest of hay and any
      soft material they can find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While Nibbler prefers to live in or close to the homes of men, he
      sometimes is driven out and then takes to the fields, especially in
      summer. There he lives in all sorts of hiding places, and isn't at all
      particular what the place is, if it promises safety and food can be
      obtained close by. I'm sorry Nibbler ever came to this country. Man
      brought him here and now he is here to stay and quite as much at home as
      if he belonged here the way the rest of you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This finishes the lessons on the order of Rodents, the animals related by
      reason of having teeth for the purpose of gnawing. I suspect these are the
      only ones in whom you take any interest, and so you will not care to come
      to school any more. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, marm,&rdquo; answered Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel, who, you remember, had
      laughed at Peter Rabbit for wanting to go to school. &ldquo;No, marm. There are
      ever so many other people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows we
      want to know more about than we now know. Isn't that so?&rdquo; Happy Jack
      turned to the others and every one nodded, even Prickly Porky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one little fellow living right near here who looks to me as if
      he must be a member of the Mouse family, but he isn't like any of the Mice
      you have told us about,&rdquo; continued Happy Jack. &ldquo;He is so small he can hide
      under a leaf. I'm sure he must be a Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Teeny Weeny the Shrew,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, smiling at
      Happy Jack. &ldquo;He isn't a Mouse. He isn't even a Rodent. I'll try to have
      him here to-morrow morning and we will see what we can find out about him
      and his relatives.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX Teeny Weeny and His Cousin
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Old Mother Nature knows, but just the same it is hard for me
      not to believe that Teeny Weeny is a member of the Mouse family,&rdquo; said
      Happy Jack Squirrel to Peter Rabbit, as they scampered along to school. &ldquo;I
      never have had a real good look at him, but I've had glimpses of him lots
      of times and always supposed him a little Mouse with a short tail. It is
      hard to believe that he isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope Old Mother Nature will put him where we can get a good look at
      him,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;Perhaps when you really see him he won't look so
      much like a Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When all had arrived Old Mother Nature began the morning lesson at once.
      &ldquo;You have learned about all the families in the order of Rodents,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;so now we will take up another and much smaller order called
      Insectivora. I wonder if any of you can guess what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit, &ldquo;as if it must have something to do with
      insects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a very good guess, Peter,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, smiling at
      him. &ldquo;It does have to do with insects. The members of this order live very
      largely on insects and worms, and the name Insectivora means
      insect-eating. There are two families in this order, the Shrew family and
      the Mole family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Teeny Weeny and Miner the Mole must be related,&rdquo; spoke Peter
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right again, Peter,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;The Shrews and the Moles are
      related in the same way that you and Happy Jack Squirrel are related.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn't Teeny Weeny the Shrew related to the Mice at all?&rdquo; asked Happy
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Many people think he is and often
      he is called Shrew Mouse. But this is a great mistake. It is the result of
      ignorance. It seems strange to me that people so often know so little
      about their near neighbors.&rdquo; She looked at Happy Jack Squirrel as she said
      this, and Happy Jack looked sheepish. He felt just as he looked. All this
      time the eyes of every one had been searching this way, that way, every
      way, for Teeny Weeny, for Old Mother Nature had promised to try to have
      him there that morning. But Teeny Weeny was not to be seen. Now and then a
      leaf on the ground close by Old Mother Nature's feet moved, but the Merry
      Little Breezes were always stirring up fallen leaves, and no one paid any
      attention to these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature understood the disappointment in the faces before her
      and her eyes began to twinkle. &ldquo;Yesterday I told you that I would try to
      have Teeny Weeny here,&rdquo; said she. A leaf moved. Stooping quickly she
      picked it up. &ldquo;And here he is,&rdquo; she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough where a second before the dead brown leaf had been was a tiny
      little fellow, so tiny that that leaf had covered him completely, and it
      wasn't a very big leaf. It was Teeny Weeny the Shrew, also called the
      Common Shrew, the Long-tailed Shrew and the Shrew Mouse, one of the
      smallest animals in all the Great World. He started to dart under another
      leaf, but Old Mother Nature stopped him. &ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; she commanded
      sharply. &ldquo;You have nothing to fear. I want everybody to have a good look
      at you, for it is high time these neighbors of yours should know you. I
      know just how nervous and uncomfortable you are and I'll keep you only a
      few minutes. Now everybody take a good look at Teeny Weeny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This command was quite needless, for all were staring with all their
      might. What they saw was a mite of a fellow less than four inches long
      from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, and of this total length
      the tail was almost half. He was slender, had short legs and mouselike
      feet. His coat was brownish above and grayish beneath, and the fur was
      very fine and soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the oddest thing about Teeny Weeny was his long, pointed head ending
      in a long nose. No Mouse has a head like it. The edges of the ears could
      be seen above the fur, but the eyes were so tiny that Peter Rabbit thought
      he hadn't any and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;Yes, he has eyes, Peter,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Look
      closely and you will see them. But they don't amount to much&mdash;little
      more than to tell daylight from darkness. Teeny Weeny depends on his nose
      chiefly. He has a very wonderful little nose, flexible and very sensitive.
      Of course, with such poor eyes he prefers the dark when there are fewer
      enemies abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this time Teeny Weeny had been growing more and more uneasy. Old
      Mother Nature saw and understood. Now she told him that he might go.
      Hardly were the words out of her mouth when he vanished, darting under
      some dead leaves. Hidden by them he made his way to an old log and was
      seen no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't he eat anything but insects and worms?&rdquo; asked Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is very fond of flesh, and if he
      finds the body of a bird or animal that has been killed he will tear it to
      pieces. He is very hot-tempered, as are all his family, and will not
      hesitate to attack a Mouse much bigger than himself. He is so little and
      so active that he has to have a great deal of food and probably eats his
      own weight in food every day. Of course, that means he must do a great
      deal of hunting, and he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes tiny little paths under the fallen leaves and in swampy places&mdash;little
      tunnels through the moss. He is especially fond of old rotted stumps and
      logs and brush piles, for in such places he can find grubs and insects. At
      the same time he is well hidden. He is active by day and night, but in the
      daytime takes pains to keep out of the light. He prefers damp to dry
      places. In winter he tunnels about under the snow. In summer he uses the
      tunnels and runways of Meadow Mice and others when he can. He eats seeds
      and other vegetable food when he cannot find insects or flesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about his enemies?&rdquo; asked Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has plenty,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;but is not so much hunted as
      the members of the Mouse family. This is because he has a strong,
      unpleasant scent which makes him a poor meal for those at all particular
      about their food. Some of the Hawks and Owls appear not to mind this, and
      these are his worst enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he any near relatives?&rdquo; asked Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;Blarina the Short-tailed Shrew, also
      called Mole Shrew, is the best known. He is found everywhere, in forests,
      old pastures and along grassy banks, but seldom far from water. He prefers
      moist ground. He is much larger and thicker than Teeny Weeny and has a
      shorter tail. People often mistake him for Miner the Mole, because of the
      thick, fine fur which is much like Miner's and his habit of tunneling
      about just beneath the surface, but if they would look at his fore feet
      they would never make that mistake. They are small and like the feet of
      the Mouse family, not at all like Miner's big shovels. Moreover, he is
      smaller than Miner, and his tunnels are seldom in the earth but just under
      the leaves and grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His food is much the same as that of Teeny Weeny&mdash;worms, insects,
      flesh when he can get it, and seeds. He is fond of beechnuts. He is quite
      equal to killing a Mouse of his own size or bigger and does not hesitate
      to do so when he gets the chance. He makes a soft, comfortable nest under
      a log or in a stump or in the ground and has from four to six babies at a
      time. Teeny Weeny sometimes has as many as ten. The senses of smell and
      hearing are very keen and make up for the lack of sight. His eyes, like
      those of other Shrews, are probably of use only in distinguishing light
      from darkness. His coat is dark brownish-gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another of the Shrew family is the Marsh Shrew, also called Water Shrew
      and Black-and white Shrew. He is longer than either of the others and, as
      you have guessed, is a lover of water. He is a good swimmer and gets much
      of his food in the water&mdash;water Beetles and grubs and perhaps
      Tadpoles and Minnows. Now who among you knows Miner the Mole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. That is, I have seen him,&rdquo; replied Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Peter, to-morrow morning we will see how much you know about
      Miner,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX Four Busy Little Miners
    </h2>
    <p>
      Scampering along on his way to school and thinking of nothing so
      uninteresting as watching his steps, Peter Rabbit stubbed his toes. Yes,
      sir, Peter stubbed his toes. With a little exclamation of impatience he
      turned to see what he had stumbled over. It was a little ridge where the
      surface of the ground had been raised a trifle since Peter had passed that
      way the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Now isn't that funny?&rdquo; he demanded of no one at all, for
      he was quite alone. Then he answered himself. &ldquo;It certainly is,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;Here I am on my way to learn something about Miner the Mole, and I trip
      over one of the queer little ridges he is forever making. It wasn't here
      yesterday, so that means that he is at work right around here now. Hello,
      I thought so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter had been looking along that little ridge and had discovered that it
      ended only a short distance from him. Now as he looked at it again, he saw
      the flat surface of the ground at the end of the ridge rise as if being
      pushed up from beneath, and that little ridge became just so much longer.
      Peter understood perfectly. Out of sight beneath the surface Miner the
      Mole was at work. He was digging a tunnel, and that ridge was simply the
      roof to that tunnel. It was so near the surface of the ground that Miner
      simply pushed up the loose soil as he bored his way along, and this made
      the little ridge over which Peter had stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter watched a few minutes, then turned and scampered,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, for the Green Forest. He arrived at school quite
      out of breath, the last one. Old Mother Nature was about to chide him for
      being late, but noticing his excitement, she changed her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Peter,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What is it now? Did you have a narrow escape on
      your way here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;No, I didn't have a narrow
      escape, but I discovered something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack Squirrel snickered. &ldquo;Peter is always discovering something,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;He is a great little discoverer. Probably he has just found out
      that the only way to get anywhere on time is to start soon enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No such thing!&rdquo; declared Peter indignantly. &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him, Peter,&rdquo; interrupted Old Mother Nature soothingly. &ldquo;What
      was it you discovered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the very one we are to learn about is only a little way from here
      this very minute. Miner the Mole is at work on the Green Meadow; close to
      the edge of the Green Forest,&rdquo; cried Peter eagerly. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you
      would want to-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have this morning's lesson right there where we can at least see his
      works if not himself,&rdquo; interrupted Old Mother Nature again. &ldquo;That is fine,
      Peter. We will go over there at once. It is always better to see things
      than to merely hear about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Peter led the way to where he had stumbled over that little ridge on
      his way to school. It was longer than when he had left it, but even as the
      others crowded about to look, the earth was pushed up and it grew in
      length. Old Mother Nature stooped and made a little hole in that ridge.
      Then she put her lips close to it and commanded Miner to come out. She
      spoke softly, pleasantly, but in a way that left no doubt that she
      expected to be obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was. Almost at once a queer, long, sharp nose was poked out of the
      little hole she had made, and a squeaky voice asked fretfully, &ldquo;Do I have
      to come way out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly do,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;I want some of your
      friends and neighbors to get a good look at you, and they certainly can't
      do that with only that sharp nose of yours to be seen. Now scramble out
      here. No one will hurt you. I will keep you only a few minutes. Then you
      can go back to your everlasting digging. Out with you, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the others gathered in a little circle close about that hole there
      scrambled into view one of the queerest little fellows in all the Great
      World. Few of them had ever seen him close to before. He was a stout
      little fellow with the softest, thickest, gray coat imaginable. He was
      about six inches long and had a funny, short, pinkish-white, naked tail
      that at once reminded Peter of an Angleworm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head seemed to be set directly on his shoulders, so that there was no
      neck worth mentioning. His nose was long and sharp and extended far beyond
      his mouth. Neither ears nor eyes were to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Striped Chipmunk at once wanted to know how Miner could see. &ldquo;He doesn't
      see as you do,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He has very small eyes, tiny
      things, which you might find if you should part the fur around them, but
      they are of use only to distinguish light from darkness. Miner hasn't the
      least idea what any of you look like. You see, he spends his life under
      ground and of course has no use for eyes there. They would be a nuisance,
      for the dirt would be continually getting in them if they were any larger
      than they are or were not protected as they are. If you should feel of
      Miner's nose you would find it hard. That is because he uses it to bore
      with in the earth. Just notice those hands of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At once everybody looked at Miner's hands. No one ever had seen such hands
      before. The arms were short but looked very strong. The hands also were
      rather short, but what they lacked in length they made up in width and
      they were armed with long, stout claws. But the queer thing about them was
      the way he held them. He held them turned out. His hind feet were not much
      different from the hind feet of the Mouse family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miner was plainly uncomfortable. He wriggled about uneasily and it was
      very clear that he was there only because Old Mother Nature had commanded
      him to be there, and that the one thing he wanted most was to get back
      into his beloved ground. Old Mother Nature saw this and took pity on him.
      She picked him up and placed him on the ground where there was no opening
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Miner,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;your friends and neighbors have had a good look
      at you, and I know just how uncomfortable you feel. There is but one thing
      more I'll ask of you. It is that you will show us how you can dig. Johnny
      Chuck thinks he is a pretty good digger. Just show him what you can do in
      that line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miner didn't wait to be told twice. The instant Old Mother Nature stopped
      speaking he began to push and bore into the earth with his sharp nose. One
      of those great, spadelike hands was slipped up past his face and the claws
      driven in beside his nose. Then it was swept back and the loosened earth
      with it. The other hand was used in the same way. It was quite plain to
      everybody why they were turned out in the way they were. There was nothing
      slow about the way Miner used that boring nose and those shoveling hands.
      Peter Rabbit had hardly time for half a dozen long breaths before Miner
      the Mole had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some digging!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never again as long as I live will I boast of my digging,&rdquo; declared
      Johnny Chuck admiringly. From the point where Miner had entered the ground
      a little ridge was being pushed up, and they watched it grow surprisingly
      fast as the little worker under the sod pushed his tunnel along in the
      direction of his old tunnels. It was clear that he was in a hurry to get
      back where he could work in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer life,&rdquo; exclaimed Happy Jack Squirrel. &ldquo;He can't have much
      fun. I should think it would be awful living in the dark that way all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget that he cannot see as you can, and so prefers the dark,&rdquo;
       replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;As for fun, he gets that in his work. He is
      called Miner because he lives in the ground and is always tunneling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he eat, the roots of plants?&rdquo; asked Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;A lot of people think that,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;and often Miner is charged with destroying growing crops, eating seed
      corn, etc. That is because his tunnels are found running along the rows of
      plants. The fact is Miner has simply been hunting for grubs and worms
      around the roots of those plants. He hasn't touched the plants at all. I
      suspect that Danny Meadow Mouse or one of his cousins could explain who
      ate the seed corn and the young plants. They are rather fond of using
      Miner's tunnels when he isn't about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danny hung his head and looked guilty, but didn't say anything. &ldquo;The only
      harm Miner does is sometimes to tunnel so close to garden plants that he
      lets air in around the tender roots and they dry out,&rdquo; continued Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;His food consists almost wholly of worms, grubs and
      insects, and he has to have a great many to keep him alive. That is why he
      is so active. Those tunnels of his which seem to be without any plan are
      made in his search for food. He is especially fond of Angleworms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a matter of fact, he is a useful little fellow. The only time he
      becomes a nuisance to man is when he makes his little ridges across smooth
      lawns. Even then he pays for the trouble by destroying the grubs in the
      grass roots, grubs that in their turn would destroy the grass. When you
      see his ridges you may know that his food is close to the surface. When in
      dry or cold weather the worms go deep in the ground, Miner follows and
      then there is no trace of his tunnels on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Night and day are all the same to him. He works and sleeps when he
      chooses. In winter he tunnels below the frost line. You all noticed how
      dense his fur is. That is so the sand cannot work down in it. His home is
      a snug nest of grass or leaves in a little chamber under the ground in
      which several tunnels offer easy means of escape in case of sudden
      danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Miner any near relatives?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;All are much alike in habits. One
      who lives a little farther north is called Brewer's Mole or the
      Hairytailed Mole. His tail is a little longer than Miner's and is covered
      with fine hair. The largest and handsomest member of the family is the
      Oregon Mole of the Northwest. His coat is very dark and his fur extremely
      fine. His ways are much the same as those of Miner whom you have just met,
      excepting that when he is tunneling deep in the ground he pushes the earth
      to the surface after the manner of Grubby Gopher, and his mounds become a
      nuisance to farmers. When he is tunneling just under the surface he makes
      ridges exactly like these of his eastern cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the oddest member of the Mole family is the Star-nosed Mole. He looks
      much like Miner with the exception of his nose and tail. His nose has a
      fringe of little fleshy points, twenty-two of them, like a many-pointed
      star. From this he gets his name. His tail is a little longer than Miner's
      and is hairy. During the late fall and winter this becomes much enlarged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This funny little fellow with the star-like nose is especially fond of
      moist places, swamps, damp meadows, and the banks of streams. He is not at
      all afraid of the water and is a good swimmer. Sometimes he may be seen
      swimming under the ice in winter. He is seldom found where the earth is
      dry. For that matter, none of the family are found in those sections where
      there are long, dry periods and the earth becomes baked and hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fur of Miner and his cousins will lay in either direction, which
      keeps it smooth no matter whether the wearer is going forward or backward.
      Otherwise it would be badly mussed up most of the time. Altogether these
      little underground workers are most interesting little people when you
      know them. But that is something few people have a chance to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now just remember that the Shrews and the Moles belong to the order of
      Insectivora, meaning eaters of insects, and are the only two families in
      that order. And don't despise either of them, for they do a great deal of
      good in the Great World, more than some right here whom I might name, but
      will not. School is dismissed.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI Flitter the Bat and His Family
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the dusk of early evening, as Peter Rabbit sat trying to make up his
      mind whether to spend that night at home in the dear Old Briar-patch with
      timid little Mrs. Peter or go over to the Green Forest in search of
      adventure, a very fine, squeaky voice which came right out of the air
      above him startled him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better stay at home, Peter Rabbit. Better stay at home to-night,&rdquo; said
      the thin, squeaky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Flitter!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, as he stared up at a little dark form
      darting this way, twisting that way, now up, now down, almost brushing
      Peter's head and then flying so high he could hardly be seen. &ldquo;Why should
      I stay at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I saw Old Man Coyote sneaking along the edge of the Green Forest,
      Reddy Fox is hunting on the Green Meadows, and Hooty the Owl is on watch
      in the Old Orchard,&rdquo; replied Flitter the Red Bat. &ldquo;Of course it is no
      business of mine what you do, Peter Rabbit, but were I in your place I
      certainly would stay at home. Gracious! I'm glad I can go where I please
      when I please. You ought to fly, Peter. You ought to fly. There is nothing
      like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; sighed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't say I didn't warn you,&rdquo; squeaked Flitter, and darted away in
      the direction of Farmer Brown's house. Peter wisely decided that the dear
      Old Briar-patch was the best place for him that night, so he remained at
      home, to the joy of timid little Mrs. Peter, and spent the night eating,
      dozing and wondering how it would seem to be able to fly like Flitter the
      Bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flitter was still in his mind when he started for school the next morning,
      and by the time he got there he was bubbling over with curiosity and
      questions. He could hardly wait for school to be called to order. Old
      Mother Nature noticed how fidgety he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you on your mind, Peter?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you tell us that the Shrew family and the Mole family are the only
      families in this country in the order of insect-eaters?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly did,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. &ldquo;Doesn't Flitter the Bat live on
      insects?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;He does,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;In fact he lives
      altogether on insects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why isn't he a member of that order?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled, for she was pleased that Peter had thought of
      this. &ldquo;That question does you credit, Peter,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The reason is
      that he and his relatives are so very different from other animals that
      they have been placed in an order of their own. It is called the
      Chi-rop-ter-a, which means wing-handed. How many of you know Flitter the
      Bat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've often seen him,&rdquo; declared Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Chatterer the Red Squirrel. Each of the others said the
      same thing. There wasn't one who hadn't watched and envied Flitter darting
      about in the air just at dusk of early evening or as the Black Shadows
      were stealing away in the early morning. Old Mother Nature smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing him isn't knowing him,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Who is there who knows anything
      about him and his ways save that he flies at night and catches insects in
      the air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a minute or two, but no one spoke. The fact is there was not
      one who really knew anything about Flitter. &ldquo;It is one of the strange
      things of life,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that people often know nothing about the
      neighbors whom they see every day. But in this case it is not to be
      wondered at. I suspect none of you has seen Flitter, excepting in the air,
      and then he moves so rapidly that there is no chance to get a good look at
      him. I think this is just the time and place for you to really make the
      acquaintance of Flitter the Red Bat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped over to a bush and parted the leaves. Hanging from a twig was
      what appeared at first glance to be a rumpled, reddish-brown dead leaf.
      She touched it lightly. At once it came to life, stirring uneasily. A
      thin, squeaky voice peevishly demanded to know what was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have some callers, a few of your friends who want to get really
      acquainted with you. Suppose you wake up for a few minutes,&rdquo; explained Old
      Mother Nature pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flitter, for that is just who it was, yawned once or twice sleepily, shook
      himself, then grinned down at the wondering faces of his friends crowded
      about just under him. &ldquo;Hello, folks,&rdquo; said he in that thin, squeaky voice
      of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight fell full on him, but he seemed not to mind it in the least.
      In fact, he appeared to enjoy its warmth. He was hanging by his toes, head
      down, his wings folded. He was about four inches long, and his body was
      much like that of a Mouse. His fur was fine and thick, a beautiful
      orange-red. For his size his ears were large. Instead of the long head and
      sharp nose of the Mouse family, Flitter had a rather round head and blunt
      nose. Almost at once Peter Rabbit made a discovery. It was that Flitter
      possessed a pair of bright, little, snapping eyes and didn't seem in the
      least bothered by the bright light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did that saying 'blind as a Bat' ever come from?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;Goodness knows; I don't,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There is
      nothing blind about Flitter. He sleeps through the day and does his
      hunting in the dusk of evening or early morning, but if he is disturbed
      and has to fly during the day, he has no trouble in seeing. Flitter,
      stretch out one of your wings so that everybody can see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently Flitter stretched out one of his wings. Everybody gasped, for
      it was the first time any of them ever had seen one of those wings near
      enough to know just what it was like. Flitter's arm was long, especially
      from his elbow to his hand. But the surprising thing was the length of his
      three fingers. Each finger appeared to be about as long as the whole arm.
      From his shoulder a thin, rubbery skin was stretched to the ends of the
      long fingers, then across to the ankle of his hind foot on that side, and
      from there across to the tip of his tail. A little short thumb with a
      long, curved claw stuck up free from the edge of the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can see just why he is called winghanded,&rdquo; explained Old Mother
      Nature, as Flitter folded the wing. In a minute he began to clean it.
      Everybody laughed, for it was funny to watch him. He would take the skin
      of the wing in his mouth and pull and stretch it as if it were rubber. He
      washed it with his tiny tongue. Then he washed his fur. You see, Flitter
      is very neat. With the little claw of his thumb he scratched his head and
      combed his hair. All the time he remained hanging head down, clinging to
      the twig with his toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mrs. Flitter?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; replied Flitter, beginning on the other wing. &ldquo;She's quite
      equal to looking after herself, so I don't worry about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor about your babies. Flitter, I'm ashamed of you. You are a poor kind
      of father,&rdquo; declared Old Mother Nature severely. &ldquo;If you don't know where
      to find your family, I'll show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped over to the very next tree, parted the leaves, and there, sure
      enough, hung Mrs. Flitter fast asleep. And clinging to her were three of
      the funniest babies in all the Great World! All were asleep, and Old
      Mother Nature didn't awaken them. As for Flitter, he seemed to take not
      the slightest interest in his family, but went right on with his toilet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flitter the Red Bat is one of the best known of the whole family in this
      country,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, as they left Flitter to resume his nap.
      He is found from the East to the Far West, from ocean to ocean. Like the
      birds, he migrates when cold weather comes, returning in the early summer.
      Although, like all Bats, he sleeps all day as a rule, he doesn't mind the
      sunlight, as you have just seen for yourselves. Sometimes on dull, dark
      days he doesn't wait for evening, but flies in the afternoon. Usually he
      is the first of the Bat family to appear in the evening, often coming out
      while it is still light enough to show the color of his red coat. No other
      member of his family has a coat of this color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people call him the Tree Bat. After seeing him hanging over there I
      think you can guess why. He rarely goes to a cave for his daytime sleep,
      as most of his relatives do, but hangs by his toes from a twig of a tree
      or bush, frequently not far from the ground, just as he is right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As all of you who have watched him know, Flitter is a swift flier. This
      is because his wings are long and narrow. They are made for speed. I want
      you to know that the Bats are among the most wonderful of all my little
      people. Few if any birds can equal them in the air because of their
      wonderful ability to twist and turn. They are masters of the art of
      flying. Moreover, they make no sound with their wings, something which
      only the Owls among birds can boast of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all saw the three babies clinging to Mrs. Flitter. Most Bats have but
      two babies at a time, occasionally only one, but the Red Bat and his
      larger cousin, the Hoary Bat, have three or four. Mrs. Flitter carries her
      babies about with her until they are quite big. When they are too large to
      be carried she leaves them hanging in a tree while she hunts for her
      meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flitter has many cousins. One of these is the Little Brown Bat, one of
      the smallest members of the family and found all over the country. He is
      brown all over. He is sometimes called the Cave Bat, because whenever a
      cave is to be found he sleeps there. Sometimes great numbers of these
      little Bats are found crowded together in a big cave. When there is no
      cave handy, a barn or hollow tree is used. Often he will creep behind the
      closed blinds of a house to spend the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very like this little fellow in color is his cousin the Big Brown Bat,
      called the House Bat and the Carolina Bat. He is especially fond of the
      homes of men. He is a little bigger than the Red Bat. While the latter is
      one of the first Bats to appear in the evening, the former is one of the
      last, coming out only when it is quite dark. He also found all over the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Silvery Bat is of nearly the same size and in many places is more
      common than any its cousins. The fur is dark brown or black with white
      tips, especially in the young. From this it gets its name. One of the
      largest and handsomest of the Bat cousins, and one of the rarest is the
      Hoary Bat. His fur is a mixture of dark and light brown tipped with white.
      He is very handsome. His wings are very long and narrow and he is one of
      the most wonderful of all fliers. He is a lover of the Green Forest and
      does his hunting high above the tree-tops, making his appearance late in
      the evening. Like the Red Bat he spends the hours of daylight hanging in a
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down in the Southeast is a member of the family with ears so big that he
      is called the Big-eared Bat. He is a little chap, smaller than Little
      Brown Bat, and his ears are half as long his head and body together. What
      do you think of that? For his size he has the biggest ears of any animal
      in all this great country. A relative in the Southwest is the Big-eared
      Bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All members of the Bat family are drinkers and usually the first thing
      they do when they start out at dusk is to seek water. All live wholly on
      insects, and for this reason they are among the very best friends of man.
      They eat great numbers of Mosquitoes. They do no harm whatever, which is
      more than can be said for some of the rest of you little folks. Now who
      shall we learn about next?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII An Independent Family
    </h2>
    <p>
      Just as Old Mother Nature asked who they should learn about next, Happy
      Jack Squirrel spied some one coming down the Lone Little Path. &ldquo;See who's
      coming!&rdquo; cried Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody turned to look down the Lone Little Path. There, ambling along
      in the most matter-of-fact and unconcerned way imaginable, came a certain
      small person who was dressed wholly in black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jimmy Skunk,&rdquo; cried Chatterer the Red Squirrel. &ldquo;What are you
      doing over here in the Green Forest?&rdquo; Jimmy Skunk looked up and grinned.
      It was a slow, good-natured grin. &ldquo;Hello, everybody,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I thought
      I would just amble over here and see your school. I suppose all you
      fellows are getting so wise that pretty soon you will think you know all
      there is to know. Have any of you seen any fat Beetles around here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Jimmy noticed Old Mother Nature and hastened to bow his head in
      a funny way. &ldquo;Please excuse me, Mother Nature,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought school
      was over. I don't want to interrupt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. The fact is, Old Mother Nature is rather fond of
      Jimmy Skunk. &ldquo;You aren't interrupting,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The fact is, we had
      just ended the lesson about Flitter the Bat and his relatives, and were
      trying to decide who to study about next. I think you came along at just
      the right time. You belong to a large and rather important order, one that
      all these little folks here ought to know about. How many cousins have
      you, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Skunk looked a little surprised at the question. He scratched his
      head thoughtfully. &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have several close cousins in
      the Skunk branch of the family, but I presume you want to know who my
      cousins are outside of the Skunk branch. They are Shadow the Weasel, Billy
      Mink and Little Joe Otter. These are the only ones I can think of now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about Digger the Badger?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of surprise swept over Jimmy Skunk's face. &ldquo;Digger the Badger!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. &ldquo;Digger the Badger is no cousin of mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut!&rdquo; chided Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Tut, tut, tut, Jimmy Skunk! It
      is high time you came to school. Digger the Badger is just as much a
      cousin of yours as is Shadow the Weasel. You are members of the same order
      and it is a rather large order. It is called the Car-niv-o-ra, which means
      'flesh-eating.' You are a member of the Marten or Weasel family, and that
      family is called the 'Mus-tel-i-dae.' Digger the Badger is also a member
      of that family. That means that you two are cousins. You and Digger and
      Glutton the Wolverine belong to the stout-bodied branch of the family.
      Billy Mink, Little Joe Otter, Shadow the Weasel, Pekan the Fisher and
      Spite the Marten belong to its slim-bodied branch. But all are members of
      the same family despite the difference in looks, and thus, of course, are
      cousins. Seeing that you are here, Jimmy, I think we will find out just
      how much these little folks know about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter Rabbit, tell us what you know about Jimmy Skunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know one thing about him,&rdquo; declared Peter, &ldquo;and that's that he is the
      most independent fellow in the world. He isn't afraid of anybody. I saw
      Buster Bear actually step out of his way the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Skunk grinned. &ldquo;Buster always treats me very politely,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have noticed that everybody does, even Farmer Brown's boy,&rdquo; spoke up
      Happy Jack Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy enough to be independent when everybody is afraid of you,&rdquo;
       sputtered Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just why is everybody afraid of Jimmy Skunk,&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are afraid of that little scent gun he carries,&rdquo; spoke up Peter
      Rabbit. &ldquo;I wish I had one just like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head. &ldquo;It wouldn't do, Peter, to trust you
      with a gun like Jimmy Skunk's,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You are altogether too heedless
      and careless. If you had a scent gun like Jimmy's, I am afraid there would
      be trouble in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadow all the time. I
      suspect that you would drive everybody else away. Jimmy is never heedless
      or careless. He never uses that little scent gun unless he is in real
      danger or thinks he is. Usually he is pretty sure that he is before he
      uses it. I'll venture to say that not one of you has seen Jimmy use that
      little scent gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked at Jumper the Hare. Jumper looked at Chatterer. Chatterer
      looked at Happy Jack. Happy Jack looked at Danny Meadow Mouse. Danny
      looked at Striped Chipmunk. Striped looked at Johnny Chuck. Johnny looked
      at Whitefoot the Wood Mouse. Then all looked at Old Mother Nature and
      shook their heads. &ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Jimmy is wonderfully
      well armed, but for defense only. He never makes the mistake of misusing
      that little scent gun. But everybody knows he has it, so nobody interferes
      with him. Now, Peter, what more do you know about Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's lazy,&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not lazy,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy Skunk. &ldquo;I'm no more lazy than you are. You
      call me lazy just because I don't hurry. I don't have to hurry, and I
      never can see any good in hurrying when one doesn't have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; interposed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Go on, Peter, with what you
      know about Jimmy.&rdquo; &ldquo;He is good-natured,&rdquo; said Peter, and grinned at Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy grinned back. &ldquo;Thank you, Peter,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of the best-natured people I know,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;I guess
      it is a lucky thing for the rest of us that he is. I have noticed that fat
      people are usually good-natured, and Jimmy is nearly always fat. In fact,
      I don't think I have seen him what you would call really thin excepting
      very early in the spring. He eats Beetles and grubs and Grasshoppers and
      Crickets and insects of all sorts. I am told that he steals eggs when he
      can find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he catches members of my family when he can,&rdquo; spoke up Danny
      Meadow Mouse. &ldquo;I never feel safe with Jimmy Skunk very near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy didn't look at all put out. &ldquo;I might as well confess that tender
      Mouse is rather to my liking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I might add that I also enjoy
      a Frog now and then, or a Lizard or a fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also you might mention that young birds don't come amiss when you can get
      them,&rdquo; spoke up Chatterer the Red Squirrel maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked up at Chatterer. &ldquo;That's a case of the pot calling the kettle
      black,&rdquo; said he and Chatterer made a face at him. But Chatterer said
      nothing more, for he knew that all the others knew that what Jimmy said
      was true: Chatterer had robbed many a nest of young birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all you know about Jimmy?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature of Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it is,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;excepting that he lives in a hole in the
      ground, and I seldom see him out in winter. I rather think he sleeps all
      winter, the same as Johnny Chuck does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got another think coming, Peter,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I sleep a lot
      during the winter, but I don't go into winter quarters until well after
      snow comes, and I don't sleep the way Johnny Chuck does. Sometimes I go
      out in winter and hunt around a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you dig your house?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy shook his head. &ldquo;Not when I can help myself,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;It is too
      much work. If I have to I do, but I would much rather use one of Johnny
      Chuck's old houses. His houses suit me first rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you all to look at Jimmy very closely,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;You will notice that he is about the size of Black Pussy, the Cat from
      Farmer Brown's, and that his coat is black with broad white stripes. But
      not all Skunks are marked alike. I dare say that no two of Jimmy's
      children would be exactly alike. I suspect that one or more might be all
      black, with perhaps a little bit of white on the tail. Notice that Jimmy's
      front feet have long, sharp claws. He uses these to dig out grubs and
      insects in the ground, and for pulling over sticks and stones in his
      search for beetles. Also notice that he places his feet on the ground very
      much as does Buster Bear. That big, bushy tail of his is for the purpose
      of warning folks. Jimmy never shoots that little scent gun without first
      giving warning. When that tail of his begins to go up in the air, wise
      people watch out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that Jimmy Skunk and his
      family do a great deal of harm. The truth is, they do a great deal of good
      to man. Once in a while they will make the mistake of stealing Chickens or
      eggs, but it is only once in a while. They make up for all they take in
      this way by the pests they destroy. Jimmy and Mrs. Skunk have a large
      family each year, usually from six to ten. Mrs. Skunk usually is living by
      herself when the babies are born, but when they are big enough to walk
      their father rejoins the family, and you may see them almost any pleasant
      evening starting out together to hunt for Grasshoppers, Beetles and other
      things. Often the whole family remains together the whole winter, not
      breaking up until spring. Jimmy is one of the neatest of all my little
      people and takes the best of care of his handsome coat. He isn't afraid of
      water and can swim if it is necessary. He does most of his hunting at
      night, sleeping during the day. He is one of the few little wild people
      who haven't been driven away by man, and often makes his home close to
      man's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy has own cousins in nearly all parts of this great country. Way down
      in the Southwest is one called the Hog-nosed Skunk, one of the largest of
      the family. He gets his name because of the shape of his nose and the fact
      that he roots in the ground the same as a hog. He is also called the
      Badger Skunk because of the big claws on his front feet and the fact that
      he is a great digger. His fur is not so fine as that of Jimmy Skunk, but
      is rather coarse and harsh. He is even more of an insect eater than is
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smallest of Jimmy's own cousins is the Little Spotted Skunk. He is
      only about half as big as Jimmy, and his coat, instead of being striped
      with white like Jimmy's, is covered with irregular white lines and spots,
      making it appear very handsome. He lives in the southern half of the
      country and in habits is much like Jimmy, but he is much livelier.
      Occasionally he climbs low trees. Like Jimmy he eats almost anything he
      can find. And it goes without saying that, like Jimmy, he carries a little
      scent gun. By the way, Jimmy, what do you do when you are angry? Show us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy began to growl, a queer-sounding little growl, and at the same time
      to stamp the ground with his front feet. Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;When
      you see Jimmy do that,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is best to pretend you don't see him
      and keep out of his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't Jimmy any enemies at all?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on how hungry some folks get,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;Hooty the Owl doesn't seem to mind Jimmy's little scent gun, but this is
      the only one I can think of who doesn't. Some of the bigger animals might
      take him if they were starving, but even then I think they would think
      twice. Who knows where Digger the Badger is living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;He is living out on the Green Meadows over
      near the Old Pasture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Peter,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;suppose you run over and
      pay him a visit and to-morrow morning you can tell us about it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII Digger and His Cousin Glutton
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;did you visit Digger the Badger
      yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;I visited him, but I didn't find out much. He's a
      regular old grouch. He isn't the least bit neighborly. It took me a long
      time to find him. He has more holes than anybody I ever knew, and I
      couldn't tell which one is his home. When I did find him, he gave me a
      terrible scare. I didn't see him until I was right on top of him, and if I
      hadn't jumped, and jumped quickly, I guess I wouldn't be here this
      morning. He was lying flat down in the grass and he was so very flat that
      I just didn't see him. When I told him that I wanted to know all about him
      and his ways, he replied that it was none of my business how he lived or
      what he did, and that was all I could get out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sat around awhile and watched him, but he didn't do much except take a
      sun bath. He certainly is a queer-looking fellow to be a member of the
      Weasel family. There's nothing about him that looks like a Weasel, that I
      could see. Of course, he isn't as broad as he is long, but he looks almost
      that when he is lying flat down and that long hair of his is spread out on
      both sides. He really has a handsome coat when you come to look at it. It
      is silvery gray and silky looking. It seems to be parted right down the
      middle of his back. His tail is rather short, but stout and hairy. His
      head and face are really handsome. His cheeks, chin and a broad stripe
      from his nose right straight back over his head are white. On each cheek
      is a bar of black. The back part of each ear is black, and so are his
      feet. He has rather a sharp nose. Somehow when he is walking he makes me
      think of a little, flattened-out Bear with very short legs. And such claws
      as he has on his front feet! I don't know any one with such big strong
      claws for his size. I guess that must be because he is such a digger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a very good guess, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Has any one
      here ever seen him dig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did once,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I happened to be over near where he lives
      when Farmer Brown's boy came along and surprised Digger some distance from
      one of his holes. Digger didn't try to get to one of those holes; he
      simply began to dig. My gracious, how the sand did fly! He was out of
      sight in the ground before Farmer Brown's boy could get to him. Johnny
      Chuck is pretty good at digging, but he simply isn't in the same class
      with Digger the Badger. No one is that I know of, unless it is Miner the
      Mole. I guess this is all I know about him, excepting that he is a great
      fighter. Once I saw him whip a dog almost twice his size. I never heard
      such hissing and snarling and growling. He wouldn't tell me anything about
      how he lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Peter, very good,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;That's as much
      as I expected you would be able to find out. Digger is a queer fellow. His
      home is on the great plains and in the flat, open country of the Middle
      West and Far West, where Gophers and Ground Squirrels and Prairie Dogs
      live. They furnish him with the greater part of his food. All of them are
      good diggers, but they don't stand any chance when he sets out to dig them
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Digger spends most of his time under ground during daylight, seldom
      coming out except for a sun bath. But as soon as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun
      goes to bed for the night, Digger appears and travels about in search of a
      dinner. His legs are so short and he is so stout and heavy that he is slow
      and rather clumsy, but he makes up for that by his ability to dig. He
      doesn't expect to catch any one on the surface, unless he happens to
      surprise a Meadow Mouse within jumping distance. He goes hunting for the
      holes of Ground Squirrels and other burrowers, and when he finds one
      promptly digs. He eats Grasshoppers, Beetles and small Snakes, as well as
      such small animals as he catches. It was well for you, Peter, that you
      jumped when you did, for I suspect that Digger would have enjoyed a Rabbit
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little is known of Digger's family life, but he is a good husband.
      In winter he sleeps as Johnny Chuck does, coming out soon after the snow
      disappears in the spring. Of all my little people, none has greater
      courage. When he is cornered he will fight as long as there is a breath of
      life in him. His skin is very tough and he is further protected by his
      long hair. His teeth are sharp and strong and he can always give a good
      account of himself in a fight. He is afraid of no one of his own size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man hunts him for his fur, but man is very stupid in many things and this
      is an example. You see, Digger is worth a great deal more alive than dead,
      because of the great number of destructive Rodents he kills. The only
      thing that can be brought against him is the number of holes he digs. Mr.
      and Mrs. Digger have two to five babies late in the spring or early in the
      summer. They are born under ground in a nest of grass. As you may guess
      just by looking at Digger, he is very strong. If he once gets well into
      the ground, a strong man pulling on his tail cannot budge him. As Peter
      has pointed out, he isn't at all sociable. Mr. and Mrs. Digger are quite
      satisfied to live by themselves and be left alone. So he is rarely seen in
      daytime, but probably is out oftener than is supposed. Peter has told how
      he nearly stepped on Digger before seeing him. It is Digger's wise habit
      to lie perfectly still until he is sure he has been seen, so people often
      pass him without seeing him at all, or if they see him they take him for a
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;While Digger the Badger is a lover of the open country and doesn't like
      the Green Forest at all he has a cousin who is found only in the Green
      Forest and usually very deep in the Green Forest at that. This is Glutton
      the Wolverine, the largest and ugliest member of the family. None of you
      have seen him, because he lives almost wholly in the great forests of the
      North. He hasn't a single friend that I know of, but that doesn't trouble
      him in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glutton has several names. He is called 'Carcajou' in the Far North, and
      out in the Far West is often called 'Skunkbear.' The latter name probably
      is given him because in shape and color he looks a good deal as though he
      might be half Skunk and half Bear. He is about three feet long with a tail
      six inches long, and is thickset and heavy. His legs are short and very
      stout. His hair, including that on the tail, is long and shaggy. It is
      blackish-brown, becoming grayish on the upper part of his head and cheeks.
      His feet are black. When he walks he puts his feet flat on the ground as a
      Bear does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being so short of leg and heavy of body, he is slow in his movements. But
      what he lacks in this respect he makes up in strength and cunning. You
      think Reddy Fox and Old Man Coyote are smart, but neither begins to be as
      smart as Glutton the Wolverine. He is a great traveler, and in the Far
      North where the greater part of the fur of the world is trapped, he is a
      pest to the trappers. He will follow a trapper all day long, keeping just
      out of sight. No matter how carefully a trapper hides a trap, Glutton will
      find it and steal the bait without getting caught. Sometimes he even tears
      up the traps and takes them off and hides them in the woods. If he comes
      on a trap in which some other animal has been caught, he will eat the
      animal. His strength is so great that often he will tear his way into the
      cabins of hunters while they are absent and then eat or destroy all their
      food. His appetite is tremendous, and it is because of this that he is
      called Glutton. What he cannot eat or take away, he covers with filth so
      that no other animal will touch it. He is of ugly disposition and is hated
      alike by the animals and by man. His fur is of considerable value, but he
      is hunted more for the purpose of getting rid of him than for his fur.
      Sometimes when caught in a trap he will pick it up and carry it for miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Glutton has two or three babies in the spring. They live in a cave,
      but if a cave cannot be found, they use a hole in the ground which Mrs.
      Glutton digs. It is usually well hidden and seldom has been found by man.
      Glutton will eat any kind of flesh and seems not to care whether it be
      freshly killed or so old that it is decayed. The only way that hunters can
      protect their supplies is by covering them with great logs. Even then
      Glutton will often tear the logs apart to get at the supplies. Because of
      his great cunning, the Indians think he is possessed of an evil spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think this will do for to-day. To-morrow we will take up another branch
      of the family, some members of which all of you know. I wonder if it
      wouldn't be a good plan to have Shadow the Weasel here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such a look of dismay as swept over the faces of all those little people,
      with the exception of Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky! &ldquo;If&mdash; if&mdash;if
      you please, I don't think I'll come to-morrow morning,&rdquo; said Danny Meadow
      Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I think I shall be too busy at home and will have to miss
      that lesson,&rdquo; said Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;Don't worry, little folks,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You
      ought to know that if I had Shadow here I wouldn't let him hurt one of
      you. But I am afraid if he were here you would pay no attention to me, so
      I promise you that Shadow will not be anywhere near.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIV Shadow and His Family
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every one was on hand when school opened the next morning, despite the
      fear that the mere mention of Shadow the Weasel had aroused in all save
      Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky. You see, all felt they must be there so
      that they might learn all they possibly could about one they so feared. It
      might help them to escape should they discover Shadow hunting them
      sometime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Striped Chipmunk,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;you know something about
      Shadow the Weasel, tell us what you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I hate him!&rdquo; declared Striped Chipmunk, and all the others nodded
      their heads in agreement. &ldquo;I don't know a single good thing about him,&rdquo; he
      continued, &ldquo;but I know plenty of bad things. He is the one enemy I fear
      more than any other because he is the one who can go wherever I can. Any
      hole I can get into he can. I've seen him just twice in my life, and I
      hope I may never see him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a snake on legs,&rdquo; declared Striped Chipmunk. &ldquo;Anyway, that is what
      he made me think of, because his body was so long and slim and he twisted
      and turned so easily. He was about as long as Chatterer the Red Squirrel
      but looked longer because of his slim body and long neck. He was brown
      above and white below. His front feet were white, and his hind feet rather
      whitish, but not clear white. His short, round tail was black at the end.
      Somehow his small head and sharp face made me think of a Snake. Ugh! I
      don't like to think about him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him once, and he wasn't brown at all. Striped Chipmunk is all
      wrong, excepting about the end of his tail,&rdquo; interrupted Jumper the Hare.
      &ldquo;He was all white, every bit of him but the end of his tail, that was
      black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Striped Chipmunk is quite right and so are you,&rdquo; declared Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;Striped Chipmunk saw him in summer and you saw him in winter. He
      changes his coat according to season, just as you do yourself, Jumper. In
      winter he is trapped for his fur and he isn't called Weasel then at all,
      but Ermine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jumper and looked as if he felt a wee bit foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was he doing when you saw him?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature, turning to
      Striped Chipmunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunting,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk, and shivered. &ldquo;He was hunting me. He
      had found my tracks where I had been gathering beechnuts, and he was
      following them with his nose just the way Bowser the Hound follows Reddy
      Fox. I nearly died of fright when I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lucky to be alive,&rdquo; declared Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Striped Chipmunk and shivered again. &ldquo;I know it. I
      guess I wouldn't be if Reddy Fox hadn't happened along just then and
      frightened Shadow away. I've had a kindlier feeling for Reddy Fox ever
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never ran harder in my life than the time I saw him,&rdquo; spoke up Jumper
      the Hare. &ldquo;He was hunting me just the same way, running with his nose in
      the snow and following every twist and turn I had made. But for that
      black-tipped tail I wouldn't have seen him until too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Jimmy Skunk. &ldquo;The idea of a big fellow like you running
      from such a little fellow as my Cousin Shadow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not ashamed of running,&rdquo; declared Jumper. &ldquo;I may be ever so much
      bigger, but he is so quick I wouldn't stand the least chance in the world.
      When I suspect Shadow is about, I go somewhere else, the farther the
      better. If I could climb a tree like Chatterer, it would be different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wouldn't!&rdquo; interrupted Chatterer. &ldquo;No, it wouldn't. That fellow
      can climb almost as well as I can. The only thing that saved me from him
      once was the fact that I could make a long jump from one tree to another
      and he couldn't. He had found a hole in a certain tree where I was living,
      and it was just luck that I wasn't at home when he called. I was just
      returning when he popped out. I ran for my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the most awful fellow in all the Great World,&rdquo; declared Whitefoot
      the Wood Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Skunk chuckled right out. &ldquo;A lot you know about the Great World,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Why, you are farther from home now than you've ever been in your
      life before, yet I could walk to it in a few minutes. How do you know
      Shadow is the most awful fellow in the Great World?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just know, that's all,&rdquo; retorted Whitefoot in a very positive though
      squeaky voice. &ldquo;He hunts and kills just for the love of it, and no one, no
      matter how big he is, can do anything more awful than that. I have a lot
      of enemies. Sometimes it seems as if almost every one of my neighbors is
      looking for a Mouse dinner. But all but Shadow the Weasel hunt me when
      they are hungry and need food. I can forgive them for that. Every one must
      eat to live. But Shadow hunts me even when his stomach is so full he
      cannot eat another mouthful. That fellow just loves to kill. He takes
      pleasure in it. That is what makes him so awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whitefoot is right,&rdquo; declared Old Mother Nature, and she spoke sadly. &ldquo;If
      Shadow was as big as Buster Bear or Puma the Panther or even Tufty the
      Lynx, he would be the most terrible creature in all the Great World
      because of this awful desire to kill which fills him. He is hot-blooded,
      quick-tempered and fearless. Even when cornered by an enemy against whom
      he has no chance he will fight to the last gasp. I am sorry to say that
      there is no kindness nor gentleness in him towards any save his own
      family. Outside of that he hasn't a friend in the world, not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hasn't he any enemies?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Reddy Fox, Old Man Coyote, Hooty
      the Owl and various members of the Hawk family have to be watched for by
      him. But they do not worry him much. You see he moves so quickly, dodging
      out of sight in a flash, that whoever catches him must be quick indeed.
      Then, too, he is almost always close to good cover. He delights in old
      stone walls, stone piles, brush-grown fences, piles of rubbish and barns
      and old buildings, the places that Mice delight in. In such places there
      is always a hole to dart into in time of danger. He hunts whenever he
      feels like it, be it day or night, and often covers considerable ground,
      though nothing to compare with his big, brown, water-loving cousin, Billy
      Mink. It is because of his wonderful ability to disappear in an instant
      that he is called Shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadow is known as the Common Weasel, Short-tailed Weasel, Brown Weasel,
      Bonaparte Weasel and Ermine, and is found all over the forested parts of
      the northern part of the country. A little farther south in the East is a
      cousin very much like him called the New York Weasel. On the Great Plains
      of the West is a larger cousin with a longer tail called the Long-tailed
      Weasel, Large Ermine, or Yellow-bellied Weasel. His smallest cousin is the
      Least Weasel. The latter is not much longer than a Mouse. In winter he is
      all white, even the tip of his tail. In summer he is a purer white
      underneath than his larger cousins. All of the Weasels are alike in
      habits. When running they bound over the ground much as Peter Rabbit does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that part of the West where Yap Yap the Prairie Dog lives is a
      relative called the Blackfooted Ferret who looks like a large Weasel. He
      is about the size of Billy Mink, but instead of the rich dark brown of
      Billy's coat his coat is a creamy yellow. His feet are black and so is the
      tip of his tail. His face is whitish with a dark band across the eyes. He
      is most frequently found in Prairie dog towns and lives largely on Yap Yap
      and his friends. His ways are those of Shadow and his cousins. There is no
      one Yap Yap fears quite as much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one good thing Shadow the Weasel does is to kill Robber the Rat
      whenever they meet. Robber, as you know, is big and savage and always
      ready for a fight when cornered. But all the fight goes out of him when
      Shadow appears. Perhaps it is because he knows how hopeless it is. When
      Shadow finds a barn overrun with Rats he will sometimes stay until he has
      killed or driven out the last one. Then perhaps he spoils it all by
      killing a dozen Chickens in a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a sad thing not to be able to speak well of any one, but Shadow the
      Weasel, like Robber the Rat, has by his ways made himself hated by all the
      little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows and by man. There
      is not one to say a good word for him. Now to-morrow we will meet on the
      bank of the Smiling Pool instead of here.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV Two Famous Swimmers
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bank of the Smiling Pool was a lovely place to hold school at that
      hour of the day, which you know was just after sun-up. Everybody who could
      get there was on hand, and there were several who had not been to school
      before. One of these was Grandfather Frog, who was sitting on his big,
      green, lily pad. Another was Jerry Muskrat, whose house was out in the
      Smiling Pool. Spotty the Turtle was also there, not to mention Longlegs
      the Heron. You see, they hadn't come to school but the school had come to
      them, for that is where they live or spend most of their time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Jerry Muskrat,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature pleasantly, as
      Jerry's brown head appeared in the Smiling Pool. &ldquo;Have you seen anything
      of Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Joe went down to the Big River last night,&rdquo; replied Jerry Muskrat.
      &ldquo;I don't know when he is coming back, but I wouldn't be surprised to see
      him any minute. Billy Mink was here last evening and said he was going up
      the Laughing Brook fishing. He is likely to be back any time. One never
      can tell when that fellow will appear. He comes and goes continually. I
      don't believe he can keep still five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that can't keep still five minutes?&rdquo; demanded a new voice, and
      there was Billy Mink himself just climbing out on the Big Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry was speaking of you,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;This will be a
      good chance for you to show him that he is mistaken. I want you to stay
      here for a while and to stay right on the Big Rock. I may want to ask you
      a few questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Billy Mink dived into the Smiling Pool, and a second later his
      brown head popped out of the water and in his mouth was a fat fish. He
      scrambled back on the Big Rock and looked at Old Mother Nature a bit
      fearfully as he laid the fish down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't mean to disobey,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;I saw that fish and dived
      for him before I thought. I hope you will forgive me, Mother Nature. I
      won't do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Acting before thinking gets people into trouble sometimes,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;However, I will forgive you this time. The fact is you
      have just shown your friends here something. Go ahead and eat that fish
      and be ready to answer questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Billy Mink sat there on the Big Rock every one had a good look at him.
      One glance would tell any one that he was a cousin of Shadow the Weasel.
      He was much larger than Shadow, but of the same general shape, being long
      and slender. His coat was a beautiful dark brown, darkest on the back. His
      chin was white. His tail was round, covered with fairly long hair which
      was so dark as to be almost black. His face was like that of Shadow the
      Weasel. His legs were rather short. As he sat eating that fish, his back
      was arched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature waited until he had finished his feast. &ldquo;Now then,
      Billy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I want you to answer a few questions. Which do you like
      best, night or day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't make any particular difference to me,&rdquo; replied Billy. &ldquo;I just
      sleep when I feel like it, whether it be night or day, and then when I
      wake up I can hunt. It all depends on how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you go hunting, what do you hunt?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy grinned. &ldquo;Anything that promises a good meal,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I'm not
      very particular. A fat Mouse, a tender young Rabbit, a Chipmunk, a Frog,
      Tadpoles, Chickens, eggs, birds, fish; whatever happens to be easiest to
      get suits me. I am rather fond of fish, and that's one reason that I live
      along the Laughing Brook and around the Smiling Pool. But I like a change
      of fare, and so often I go hunting in the Green Forest. Sometimes I go up
      to Farmer Brown's for a Chicken. In the spring I hunt for nests of birds
      on the ground. In winter, if Peter Rabbit should happen along here when I
      was hungry, I might be tempted to sample Peter.&rdquo; Billy snapped his bright
      eyes wickedly and Peter shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jerry Muskrat were not my friend, I am afraid I might be tempted to
      sample him,&rdquo; continued Billy Mink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;You wouldn't dare tackle Jerry Muskrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't I?&rdquo; replied Billy. &ldquo;Just ask Jerry how he feels about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One look at Jerry's face showed everybody that Jerry, big as he was, was
      afraid of Billy Mink. &ldquo;How do you hunt when you are on land?&rdquo; asked Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way every good hunter should hunt, with eyes, nose and ears,&rdquo; replied
      Billy. &ldquo;There may be folks with better ears than I've got, but I don't
      know who they are. I wouldn't swap noses with anybody. As for my eyes,
      well, they are plenty good enough for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, you hunt very much as does your cousin, Shadow the
      Weasel,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy nodded. &ldquo;I suppose I do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there's one thing he does
      which I don't do and that's hunt just for the love of killing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once in a while I may kill more than I can eat, but I don't mean to. I
      hunt for food, while he hunts just for the love of killing.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;You all saw how Billy catches fish,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now, Billy,
      I want you to swim over to the farther bank and show us how you run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy obeyed. He slipped into the water, dived, swam under water for a
      distance, then swam with just his head out. When he reached the bank he
      climbed out and started along it. He went by a series of bounds, his back
      arched sharply between each leap. Then he disappeared before their very
      eyes, only to reappear as suddenly as he had gone. So quick were his
      movements that it was impossible for one of the little people watching to
      keep their eyes on him. It seemed sometimes as though he must have
      vanished into the air. Of course he didn't. He was simply showing them his
      wonderful ability to take advantage of every little stick, stone and bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy is a great traveler,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He really loves to
      travel up and down the Laughing Brook, even for long distances. Wherever
      there is plenty of driftwood and rubbish, Billy is quite at home, being so
      slender he can slip under all kinds of places and into all sorts of holes.
      Quick as he is on land, he is not so quick as his Cousin Shadow; and good
      swimmer as he is, he isn't so good as his bigger cousin, Little Joe Otter.
      But being equally at home on land and in water, he has an advantage over
      his cousins. Billy is much hunted for his fur, and being hunted so much
      has made him very keen-witted. Mrs. Billy makes her home nest in a hole in
      the bank or under an old stump or under a pile of driftwood, and you may
      be sure it is well hidden. There the babies are born, and they stay with
      their mother all summer. Incidentally, Billy can climb readily. Billy is
      found all over this great country of ours. When he lives in the Far North
      his fur is finer and thicker than when he lives in the South. I wish
      Little Joe Otter were here. I hoped he would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; cried Jerry Muskrat. &ldquo;I rather expected he would be
      back.&rdquo; Jerry pointed towards where the Laughing Brook left the Smiling
      Pool on its way to the Big River. A brown head was moving rapidly towards
      them. There was no mistaking that head. It could belong to no one but
      Little Joe Otter. Straight on to the Big Rock he came, and climbed up. He
      was big, being one of the largest members of his family. He was more than
      three feet long. But no one looking at him could mistake him for any one
      but a member of the Weasel family. His legs were short, very short for the
      length of his body. His tail was fairly long and broad. His coat was a
      rich brown all over, a little lighter underneath than on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's going on here?&rdquo; asked Little Joe Otter, his eyes bright with
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are holding a session of school here today,&rdquo; explained Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;And we were just hoping that you would appear. Hold up one of
      your feet and spread the toes, Little Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Joe Otter obeyed, though there was a funny, puzzled look on his
      face. &ldquo;Whyee!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;His toes are webbed like those of
      Paddy the Beaver!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they're webbed,&rdquo; said Little Joe. &ldquo;I never could swim the way I
      do if they weren't webbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you swim better than Paddy the Beaver?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say I can. If I couldn't, I guess I would go hungry most of the
      time,&rdquo; replied Little Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you go hungry? Paddy doesn't,&rdquo; retorted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paddy doesn't live on fish,&rdquo; replied Little Joe. &ldquo;I do and that's the
      difference. I can catch a fish in a tail-end race, and that's going some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might show us how you can swim,&rdquo; suggested Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Joe slipped into the water. The Smiling Pool was very still and the
      little people sitting on the bank could look right down and see nearly to
      the bottom. They saw Little Joe as he entered the water and then saw
      little more than a brown streak. A second later his head popped out on the
      other side of the Smiling Pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew, I'm glad I'm not a fish!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter and everybody laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may well be glad,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You wouldn't stand much
      chance with Little Joe around. Like Billy Mink, Little Joe is a great
      traveler, especially up and down the Laughing Brook and the Big River.
      Sometimes he travels over land, but he is so heavy and his legs are so
      short that traveling on land is slow work. When he does cross from one
      stream or pond to another, he always picks out the smoothest going.
      Sometimes in winter he travels quite a bit. Then when he comes to a smooth
      hill, he slides down it on his stomach. By the way, Little Joe, haven't
      you a slippery slide somewhere around here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Joe nodded. &ldquo;I've got one down the Laughing Brook where the bank is
      steep,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mrs. Otter and I and our children slide every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by a slippery slide?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack Squirrel, who was
      sitting in the Big Hickory-tree which grew on the bank of the Smiling
      Pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;Little Joe Otter and his family are quite as
      fond of play as any of my children,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;They get a lot of fun out
      of life. One of their ways of playing is to make a slippery slide where
      the bank is steep and the water deep. In winter it is made of snow, but in
      summer it is made of mud. There they slide down, splash into the water,
      then climb up the bank and do it all over again. In winter they make their
      slippery slide where the water doesn't freeze, and they get just as much
      fun in winter as they do in summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that means that Little Joe doesn't sleep in winter as Johnny
      Chuck does,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; exclaimed Little Joe. &ldquo;I like the winter, too. I have
      such a warm coat that I never get cold. There are always places where the
      water doesn't freeze. I can swim for long distances under ice and so I can
      always get plenty of food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you eat anything but fish?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sometimes,&rdquo; replied Little Joe. &ldquo;Once in a while I like a little
      fresh meat for a change, and sometimes when fish are scarce I eat Frogs,
      but I prefer fish, especially Salmon and Trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many babies do you have at a time?&rdquo; asked Happy Jack Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Usually one to three,&rdquo; replied Little Joe, &ldquo;and only one family a year.
      They are born in my comfortable house, which is a burrow in the bank.
      There Mrs. Otter makes a large, soft nest of leaves and grass. Now, if you
      don't mind, I think I will go on up the Laughing Brook. Mrs. Otter is
      waiting for me up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature told Little Joe to go ahead. As he disappeared, she
      sighed. &ldquo;I'm very fond of Little Joe Otter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and it distresses
      me greatly that he is hunted by man as he is. That fur coat of his is
      valuable, and man is forever hunting him for it. The Otters were once
      numerous all over this great country, but now they are very scarce, and I
      am afraid that the day isn't far away when there will be no Little Joe
      Otter. I think this will do for to-day. There are two other members of the
      Weasel family and these, like Little Joe and Billy Mink, are continually
      being hunted for their fur coats. I will tell you about them to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI Spite the Marten and Pekan the Fisher
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two remaining members of the Weasel family none of you have ever
      seen,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, when she opened school at the old meeting
      place in the Green Forest the morning after their visit to the Smiling
      Pool. &ldquo;You have never seen them because they live in the deep forests of
      the Far North. But were you living up there, you would know them, and the
      dread of them would seldom be out of your mind. One is called Spite the
      Marten and the other Pekan the Fisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spite the Marten is also called the Pine Marten and the American Sable,
      and he is one of the handsomest members of the Weasel family. Shadow the
      Weasel can climb, but he spends most of his time on the ground. Jimmy
      Skunk and Digger the Badger are not climbers at all. Little Joe Otter
      spends most of his time in the water. But Spite the Marten is a lover of
      the tree tops, and is quite as much at home there as Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he is moving about in the trees, he looks much like a very large
      Squirrel, while on the ground he might be mistaken for a young Fox. His
      coat is a rich, dark, yellowish-brown, becoming almost black on the tail
      and legs. His throat usually is yellow, though sometimes it is almost
      white. The sides of his face are grayish, and his good-sized ears are
      grayish-white on the inside. His tail is about half as long as his body
      and is covered with long hair, but isn't bushy like a Squirrel's. While
      his general shape is that of Shadow the Weasel, his body is much heavier
      in proportion to his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chatterer, you and your Cousin Happy Jack may well be thankful that Spite
      the Marten doesn't live about here, for he is very fond of Squirrels and
      delights to hunt them. He can leap from tree to tree quite as easily as
      either of you, and the only possible means of escape for a Squirrel he is
      hunting is a hole too small for Spite to get into. No Squirrel is more
      graceful in the trees than is Spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he by no means confines himself to the trees. He is quite at home on
      the ground, and there he moves with much of the quickness of Shadow the
      Weasel. He delights to hunt Rabbits and he covers great distances, being
      even more of a traveller than Billy Mink. He doesn't kill for the love of
      killing, but merely for food. If he kills more than he can eat at a meal
      he buries it, and when he is hungry again he returns to it. Like all the
      other members of his family, he is a great hunter of Mice. Also he catches
      many birds, especially those birds which nest on the ground. Birds, eggs,
      Frogs, Toads, some insects and fish vary his bill of fare. But unlike his
      smaller cousins, he eats some other things besides flesh, including
      certain nuts, berries and honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't in the least social with his own kind but prefers to live alone
      and is always ready to fight if he meets another Marten. Being so great a
      traveler he has several dens. Mrs. Spite makes her nest of grass and moss
      in a hollow tree as a rule, occasionally in a hole in the ground. She has
      from one to five babies in the spring. Spite is not a good father, for he
      has nothing to do with his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I told you in the beginning he is found only in the great forests of
      the North. The darker and deeper they are, the better it suits him. His
      own cousin, Pekan the Fisher, and Tufty the Lynx, are probably the only
      natural enemies he has much cause to fear. His one great enemy is man. His
      coat is one of the most highly prized of all furs and he is persistently
      hunted and trapped. In fact, his coat is one of the chief prizes of the
      fur trappers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this same deep, dark forest clear across the northern part of the
      country lives Pekan the Fisher, also called the Pennant Marten and
      Blackcat. He is larger and heavier than Spite the Marten and his coat is a
      brownish-black, light on the sides, and browner below. His nose, ears,
      feet and tail are black. He gets his name of Blackcat from his resemblance
      to a Cat with a bushy tail, though on the ground he looks more like a
      black Fox. Like his cousin, Spite the Marten, he lives in the pine and
      spruce forests and prefers to be near swamps. He is a splendid climber but
      spends quite as much time on the ground. However, he is even livelier in
      the trees than is Spite the Marten. Spite can catch a Squirrel in the tree
      tops, but Pekan can catch Spite, and often does. He isn't afraid of
      leaping to the ground from high up in a tree, and often when coming down a
      tree he comes down headfirst. He is very fond of hunting the cousins of
      Jumper the Hare and is so tireless that he can run them down. He is very
      clever and, like his cousin, Glutton the Wolverine, makes no end of
      trouble for trappers by stealing the baits from their traps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all remember how frightened Prickly Porky was when I merely mentioned
      Pekan the Fisher. It was because Pekan is almost the only one Prickly
      Porky has reason to fear. If Pekan is hungry he doesn't hesitate to dine
      on Porcupine. He has learned how to turn a Porcupine on his back, and, as
      you have already found out, the under part of the Porcupine is
      unprotected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just why Pekan should be called Fisher, I don't know. True, he eats fish
      when he can get them, but he isn't a water animal and doesn't go fishing
      as do Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter. His food is much the same as that
      of Spite the Marten. He is especially fond of Rabbit and Hare. He is so
      strong and savage that he can kill a Fox and often does. Bobby Coon is a
      good fighter and much bigger and heavier than Pekan, but he is no match
      for Pekan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably all of you have guessed that being a true Marten, Pekan's coat
      is highly prized by the fur trappers. He hates the presence of man and
      with good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this ends the Weasel family, but that's only one family of the order
      of Carnivora, or flesh eaters. There is one family you all know so well
      that I think we will take that up next. It is the family to which Reddy
      Fox and Old Man Coyote belong, and it is called the Dog family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning when you get here, I may have a surprise for you.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII Reddy Fox Joins the School
    </h2>
    <p>
      When school was called to order the following morning not one was missing.
      You see, with the exception of Jimmy Skunk and Prickly Porky, there was
      not one in whose life Reddy Fox did not have a most important part. Even
      Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel and Chatterer the Red Squirrel, tree folk
      though they were, had many times narrowly missed furnishing Reddy with a
      dinner. As for Johnny Chuck and Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and
      Striped Chipmunk and Danny Meadow Mouse and Whitefoot the Wood Mouse,
      there were few hours of day or night when they did not have Reddy in mind,
      knowing that to forget him even for a few minutes might mean the end of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just imagine the feelings of these little people when, just as they had
      comfortably seated themselves for the morning lesson, Reddy himself
      stepped out from behind a tree. Never before was a school so quickly
      broken up. In the winking of an eye Old Mother Nature was alone, save for
      Reddy Fox, Jimmy Skunk, and in the trees Prickly Porky the Porcupine and
      Happy Jack and Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reddy Fox looked as if he felt uncomfortable. &ldquo;I didn't mean to break up
      your school,&rdquo; said he to Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;I wouldn't have thought of
      coming if you hadn't sent for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;I didn't tell any one that I was going to send
      for you, Reddy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for I was afraid that if I did no one would
      come this morning. I promised them a surprise, but it is clear that no one
      guessed what that surprise was to be. Go over by that old stump near the
      Lone Little Path and sit there, Reddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Old Mother Nature called each of the little people by name,
      commanding each to return at once. She spoke sternly, very sternly indeed.
      One by one they appeared from all sorts of hiding places, glancing
      fearfully towards Reddy Fox, yet not daring to disobey Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last all were crowded about her as closely as they could get, Old
      Mother Nature spoke and this time her voice was soft. &ldquo;I am ashamed of
      you,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Truly I am ashamed of you. How could you think that I
      would allow any harm to come to you? Reddy Fox is here because I sent for
      him, but he is going to sit right where he is until I tell him he can go,
      and not one of you will be harmed by him. To begin with, I am going to
      tell you one or two facts about Reddy, and then I am going to find out
      just how much you have learned about him yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may seem queer to you that Reddy Fox belongs to the same family as
      Bowser the Hound, but it is true. Both are members of the Dog family and
      thus are quite closely related. Howler the Wolf and Old Man Coyote are
      also members of the family, so all are cousins. Look closely at Reddy and
      you will see at once that he looks very much like a small Dog with a
      beautiful red coat, white waistcoat, black feet and bushy tail. Now,
      Peter, you probably know as much about Reddy as any one here. At least you
      should. Tell us what you have learned in your efforts to keep out of his
      clutches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter scratched a long ear thoughtfully and glanced sideways at Reddy Fox.
      &ldquo;I certainly ought to know something about him,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;He was the
      very first person my mother warned me to watch for, because she said he
      was especially fond of young Rabbits and was the slyest, smartest and most
      to be feared of all my enemies. Since then I have found out that she knew
      just what she was talking about.&rdquo; Johnny Chuck, Danny Meadow Mouse and
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse nodded as if they quite agreed. Then Peter
      continued, &ldquo;Reddy lives chiefly by hunting, and in his turn he is hunted,
      so he needs to have sharp wits. When he isn't hunting me he is hunting
      Danny Meadow Mouse or Whitefoot or Striped Chipmunk or Mrs. Grouse, or Bob
      White, or is trying to steal one of Farmer Brown's Chickens, or is
      catching Frogs along the edge of the Smiling Pool, or grasshoppers out in
      the Green Meadows. So far as I can make out, anything Reddy can catch
      furnishes him with food. I guess he doesn't eat anything but such things
      as these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your guess is wrong, Peter,&rdquo; spoke up Reddy Fox, who had been listening
      with a grin on his crafty face. &ldquo;I am rather fond of certain kinds of
      fruits. You didn't know that, did you, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I'm glad to know it. I think it is
      dreadful to live entirely by killing others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might add,&rdquo; remarked Reddy, &ldquo;that I like a meal of fish occasionally,
      and eggs are always welcome. I am not particular what I eat so long as I
      can get my stomach full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reddy Fox hunts with ears, eyes and nose,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;Many a time
      I've watched him listening for the squeak of Danny Meadow Mouse or
      watching for the grass to move and show where Danny was hiding; and many a
      time he has found my scent with his wonderful nose and followed me just as
      Bowser the Hound follows him. I guess there isn't much going on that
      Reddy's eyes, ears and nose don't tell him. But it is Reddy's quick wits
      that the rest of us fear most. We never know what new trick he will try.
      Lots of enemies are easy to fool, but Reddy isn't one of them. Sometimes I
      think he knows more about me than I know about myself. I guess it is just
      pure luck that he hasn't caught me with some of those smart tricks of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reddy hunts both day and night, but I think he prefers night. I guess it
      all depends on how hungry he is. More than once I've seen him bringing
      home a Chicken, but I am told that he is smart enough not to steal
      Chickens near his home, but always to go some distance to get them. Also
      I've been told that he is too clever to go to the same Chicken yard two
      nights in succession. So far as I know, he isn't afraid of any one except
      a hunter with a terrible gun. He doesn't seem to mind being chased by
      Bowser the Hound at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't,&rdquo; spoke up Reddy. &ldquo;I rather enjoy it. It gives me good exercise.
      Any time I can't fool Bowser by breaking my trail so he can't find it
      again, I deserve to be caught. I am not even so terribly afraid of a
      hunter with a gun. You see, usually I can guess what a hunter will do
      better than he can what I will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;That sounds like boasting,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but it
      isn't. Reddy Fox is one of the few animals who has succeeded in holding
      his own against man, and he has done it simply by using his wits. There is
      no other animal as large as Reddy Fox who has succeeded as he has in
      living close to the homes of men. It is simply because he has made the
      most of the senses I have given him. He has learned to use his eyes, ears
      and nose at all times and to understand and make the most of the
      information they bring him. Reddy has always been hunted by man, and it is
      this very thing which has so sharpened his wits. It is seldom that he is
      guilty of making the same mistake twice. All of you little people fear
      Reddy, and I suspect some of you hate him. But always remember that he
      never kills for the love of killing, and only when he must have food.
      There would be something sadly missing in the Green Forest and on the
      Green Meadows were there no Reddy Fox. Reddy, where do you and Mrs. Reddy
      make your home? And how do you raise your babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This year our home is up in the Old Pasture,&rdquo; replied Reddy. &ldquo;We have the
      nicest kind of a house dug in the ground underneath a big rock. It has
      only one entrance, but this is because there is no need of any other. No
      one could possibly dig us out there. Last year our home was on the Green
      Meadows and there were three doorways to that. The year before we dug our
      house in a gravelly bank just within the edge of the Green Forest. The
      babies are born in a comfortable bedroom deep underground. Sometimes we
      have a storeroom in addition to the bedroom; there Mrs. Reddy and I can
      keep food when there is more than can be eaten at one meal. When the
      babies are first born in the spring and Mrs. Reddy cannot leave them, I
      take food to her. When the youngsters are big enough to use their sharp
      little teeth, we take turns hunting food for them. Usually we hunt
      separately, but sometimes we hunt together. You know often two can do what
      one cannot. If Bowser the Hound happens to find the trail of Mrs. Reddy
      when there are babies at home, she leads him far away from our home. Then
      I join her, and take her place so that she can slip away and go back to
      the babies. Bowser never knows the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our children are well trained if I do say it. We teach them how to hunt,
      how to fool their enemies, and all the tricks we have learned. No one has
      a better training than a young Fox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a conundrum for you little folks,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;When
      is a Red Fox not a Red Fox?&rdquo; Everybody blinked. Most of them looked as if
      they thought Old Mother Nature must be joking. But suddenly Chatterer the
      Red Squirrel, whose wits are naturally quick, remembered how Old Mother
      Nature had told them that there were black Gray Squirrels. &ldquo;When he is
      some other color,&rdquo; cried Chatterer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the answer,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Once in a while a pair of
      Red Foxes will have a baby who hasn't a red hair on him. He will be all
      black, with perhaps just the tip of his tail white. Or his fur will be all
      black just tipped with white. Then he is called a Black Fox or Silver Fox.
      He is still a Red Fox, yet there is nothing red about him. Sometimes the
      fur is only partly marked with black and then he is called a Cross Fox. A
      great many people have supposed that the Black or Silver Fox and the Cross
      Fox were distinct kinds. They are not. They are simply Red Foxes with
      different coats. The fur of the Silver Fox is considered by man to be one
      of the choicest of all furs and tremendous prices are paid for it. This
      means, of course, that a young Fox whose coat is black will need to be
      very smart indeed if he would live to old age, for once he has been seen
      by man he will be hunted unceasingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reddy Fox had been listening intently and now Mother Nature noticed a
      worried look on his face. &ldquo;What is it, Reddy?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You look
      anxious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am anxious,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What you have just said has worried me. You see,
      one of my cubs at home is all black. Now that I have learned that his fur
      is so valuable, Mrs. Reddy and I will have to take special pains to teach
      him all we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you all to know that Reddy Fox and Mrs. Reddy mate for life,&rdquo; said
      Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Reddy is the best of fathers and the best of mates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing I do envy Reddy,&rdquo; spoke up Peter Rabbit, &ldquo;and that is
      that big tail of his. It is a wonderful tail. I wish I had one like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How everybody laughed as they tried to picture Peter Rabbit with a big
      tail like that of Reddy Fox. &ldquo;I am afraid you wouldn't get far if you had
      to carry that around,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Even Reddy finds it rather
      a burden in wet weather when it becomes heavy with water. That is one
      reason you do not find him abroad much when it is raining or in winter
      when the snow is soft and wet. Reddy Fox is at home all over the northern
      half of this country, and everywhere he is the same sly, clever fellow
      whom you all know so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the South and some parts of the East and West, Reddy has a cousin of
      about his own size whose coat is gray with red on the sides of his neck,
      ears and across his breast. The under part of his body is reddish, his
      throat and the middle of his breast are white. He is called the Gray Fox.
      He prefers the Green Forest to the open country, for he is not nearly as
      smart as his Cousin Reddy. He is, if anything, a better runner, but his
      wits are slower and he cannot so well hold his own against man. Instead of
      making his home in a hole in the ground, he usually chooses a hollow
      tree-trunk or hollow log. The babies are born in a nest of leaves in the
      bottom of a hollow tree. In some parts of the West this Fox is called the
      Tree Fox, because often he climbs up in low trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gray Fox of the South is not the only cousin of Reddy's,&rdquo; continued
      Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;In certain parts of the Great West, on the plains,
      lives one of the smallest of Reddy's cousins, called the Kit Fox or Swift.
      He is no larger than Black Pussy, Farmer Brown's Cat, and gets his name of
      Swift from his great speed in running. He is a prairie animal and lives in
      burrows in the ground as most prairie animals do. His back is of a grayish
      color, while his sides are yellowish red. Beneath he is white. The upper
      side of his tail is yellowish-gray, below it is yellowish, and the tip is
      black. In general appearance he is more like the Gray Fox than Reddy. He
      lacks the quick wit of Reddy Fox and is easily trapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hot, dry regions of the Southwest, where the Kangaroo Rats and
      Pocket Mice live, is another cousin, closely related to the Kit Fox. This
      is called the Desert Fox. Like most of the little people who live on the
      desert, he is seldom seen by day. He is very swift of foot. He digs a
      burrow with several entrances and his food consists largely of Pocket
      Mice, Kangaroo Rats, Ground squirrels and such other small animals as are
      found in that part of the country. Like his cousin, the Kit Fox, he is not
      especially quick-witted. Neither the Kit Fox nor the Desert Fox are
      considered very valuable for their coats, and so are not hunted and
      trapped as much as are Reddy Fox and his two cousins of the Great North,
      the Arctic Fox and the Blue Fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arctic, or White Fox, lives in the Far North, in the land of snow and
      ice. He is a little fellow, bigger than the Kit Fox, but only about two
      thirds the size of Reddy Fox, and very beautiful. Way up in the Far North
      his entire coat is snowy white the year round. The fur is long, very thick
      and soft. His tail is very large and handsome. When he lives a little
      farther south, he changes his coat in the summer to one of a bluish-brown.
      But just as soon as winter approaches, he resumes his white coat. The
      young are born in a burrow in the ground, if the parents happen to be
      living far enough south for the ground to be free of snow. In the Far
      North, their home is a burrow in a snow bank, and there the babies are
      born. The white coats of the Arctic Foxes, who live in a world of white,
      are of great help to them when hunting, or when trying to escape from
      enemies. It is difficult to see them against their white surroundings. In
      summer their food consists very largely of ducks and other wild fowl which
      nest in great numbers in the Far North. In the winter they hunt for
      Lemmings, Arctic Hares and a cousin of Mrs. Grouse called the Ptarmigan,
      who lives up there. They pick the bones left by Polar Bears and Wolves.
      Getting a living in winter is not easy, and so the Arctic Fox is a great
      traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Blue Fox is really only a colored White Fox, just as the Black Fox is
      a black Red Fox, and his habits are, of course, just the same as the
      habits of the White Fox. There are some islands in the Far North, called
      the Pribilof Islands, and on them live many Blue Foxes. Both the White and
      the Blue Foxes are much hunted for their coats, which are considered very
      valuable by man. Certainly they are very beautiful. While these cousins of
      Reddy's are clever hunters they do not begin to be as quick-witted as
      Reddy, and so are much more easily trapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think this will do for Reddy Fox and his relatives. Reddy is going
      to stay right here with me, until the rest of you have had a chance to get
      home. After that you will have to watch out for yourselves as usual. Just
      remember that Reddy has become the quick-witted person he is because he
      has been so much hunted. If you are as smart as Reddy, you will understand
      that the more he hunts you, the quicker-witted you also will become.
      To-morrow we will take up Reddy's big cousins, the Wolves.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII Old Man Coyote and Howler the Wolf
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you all know to what branch of the Dog family Old Man Coyote
      belongs,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, and looked expectantly at the circle of
      little folks gathered around her. No one answered. &ldquo;Well, well, well!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;I am surprised. I am very much surprised. I
      supposed that all of you knew that Old Man Coyote is a member of the Wolf
      branch of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he is really a true Wolf?&rdquo; asked Striped Chipmunk
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is all Wolf and nothing but
      Wolf. He is the Prairie Wolf, so called because he is a lover of the great
      open plains and not of the deep forests like his big cousin, Howler the
      Timber Wolf. Reddy Fox is smart, but sometimes I believe Old Man Coyote is
      smarter. You have got to get up very early indeed to get ahead of Old Man
      Coyote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Man Coyote varies in size from not so very much bigger than Reddy Fox
      to almost the size of his big cousin, Howler the Timber Wolf. Also he
      varies in color from a general brownish-gray to a yellowish-brown, being
      whitish underneath. His face is rather longer than that of Reddy Fox. He
      has a brushy tail, but it is not as thick as Reddy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his habits, Old Man Coyote is much like Reddy, but being larger and
      stronger he is able to kill larger animals, and has won the hate of man by
      killing young Pigs, Lambs, newly born Calves and poultry. Because of this,
      he has been and is continually hunted and trapped. But like Reddy Fox the
      more he is hunted the smarter he becomes, and he is quite capable of
      taking care of himself. He is one of the swiftest of all runners. Many
      people think him cowardly because he is always ready to run away at the
      least hint of danger. He isn't cowardly, however; he is simply smart&mdash;too
      smart to run any unnecessary risk. Old Man Coyote believes absolutely in
      safety first, a very wise rule for everybody. The result is that he is
      seldom led into the mistake of simply thinking a thing is all right. He
      makes sure that it is all right. Because of this he is very hard to trap.
      No matter how hungry he may be, he will turn his back on a baited trap,
      even when the trap is so cunningly hidden that he cannot see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Man Coyote is a good father and husband and a good provider for his
      family. He and Mrs. Coyote have a large family every year, sometimes as
      many as ten babies. Their home is in the ground and is very similar to
      that of Reddy Fox. They eat almost everything eatable, including such
      animals and birds as they can catch, Frogs, Toads, Snakes and insects,
      dead bodies they may find, and even some fruits. Mr. and Mrs. Coyote often
      hunt together. Sometimes, when the children are full-grown, they all hunt
      together. When they do this they can pull down Lightfoot the Deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Man Coyote has one of the strangest voices to be heard anywhere, and
      he delights to use it, especially at night. It is like many voices
      shouting together, and one who hears it for the first time cannot believe
      that all that sound comes from one throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His big cousin, Howler the Gray Wolf, sometimes called Timber Wolf&mdash;
      is found now only in the forests of the North and the mountains of the
      Great West. Once he roamed over the greater part of this great country.
      Howler is as keen-witted as, and perhaps keener-witted than, Reddy Fox or
      Old Man Coyote, and added to this he has great strength and courage. He is
      one of the most feared of all the people of the Green Forest. In summer
      when food is plentiful, Howler and Mrs. Wolf devote themselves to the
      bringing up of their family and are careful not to be overbold. But when
      winter comes, Howler and his friends get together and hunt in packs. With
      their wonderful noses they can follow Lightfoot the Deer and run him down.
      They kill Sheep and young Cattle. The harder the winter the bolder they
      become, and they have been known to attack man himself. In the Far North
      they grow especially large, and because of the scarcity of food there in
      winter, they become exceedingly fierce. They can go an astonishingly long
      time without food and still retain their strength. But hunger makes them
      merciless. They will not attack each other, but if one in the pack becomes
      injured, the others will turn upon him, and kill and eat him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howler and Mrs. Wolf mate for life, and each is at all times loyal to the
      other. They are the best of parents, and the little Wolves are carefully
      trained in all that a Wolf should know. Always the hand of man has been
      against them, and this fact has developed their wits and cunning to a
      wonderful degree. Man in his effort to destroy them has used poison,
      cleverly hiding it in pieces of meat left where Howler and his friends
      could find them. Howler soon found out that there was something wrong with
      pieces of meat left about, and now it is seldom that any of his family
      come to harm in that way. He is equally cunning in discovering traps, even
      traps buried in one of his trails. Sometimes he will dig them up and
      spring them without being caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Wolves hunt in packs they have a leader, usually the strongest or
      the smartest among them, and this leader they obey. In all the great
      forests there is no more dreadful sound than the howling of a pack of
      wolves. There is something in it that strikes terror to the hearts of all
      who hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The color of Howler's coat usually is brownish-gray and that is why he is
      called the Gray Wolf; but sometimes it is almost black, and in the Far
      North it becomes snowy white. Howler is very closely related to the Dogs
      which men keep as pets. They are really first cousins. Few Dogs dare meet
      Howler in battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit, &ldquo;I am glad Howler doesn't live around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You well may be,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He would make just about one
      bite of you, Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter shivered. &ldquo;Are Old Man Coyote and Howler friends?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't call them exactly friends,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Old
      Man Coyote takes pains to keep out of Howler's way, but he is clever
      enough to know that when Howler has made a good kill there may be some
      left after Howler has filled his own stomach. So when Howler is hunting in
      Old Man Coyote's neighbor hood, the latter keeps an eye and ear open to
      what is going on. In the long-ago days when Thunderfoot the Bison was lord
      of the prairies, Howler's family lived on the prairies as well as in the
      forests, but now Howler sticks pretty closely to the forests and
      mountains, leaving the prairies and brushy plains to Old Man Coyote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All branches of the Dog family do one thing: they walk on their toes.
      They never put the whole foot down flat as does Buster Bear. And, as you
      have already discovered, all branches of the Dog family are very smart.
      They are intelligent. Hello, there is Black Pussy, the cat from Farmer
      Brown's, coming down the Lone Little Path! I suspect it will be well for
      some of you smallest ones to get out of sight before she arrives. She
      doesn't belong over here in the Green Forest, but she has a cousin who
      does, Yowler the Bob Cat. Shall I tell you about Yowler and his cousins
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd love to have you!&rdquo; cried Happy Jack, speaking for all. Then, as
      Black Pussy was drawing near, they separated and went their several ways.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX Yowler and His Cousin Tufty
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jumper the Hare arrived at school a little late and quite out of breath
      from hurrying. His big soft eyes were shining with excitement. &ldquo;You look
      as though you had had an adventure, Jumper,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; replied Jumper. &ldquo;It is a wonder I am here at all; I came to near
      furnishing Yowler the Bob Cat a breakfast that it makes me shiver just to
      think of it. I guess if I hadn't been thinking about him, he would have
      caught me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us all about it,&rdquo; demanded Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing Black Pussy over here yesterday, and knowing that to-day's lesson
      was to be about Yowler, I couldn't get cats out of my mind all day
      yesterday,&rdquo; began Jumper. &ldquo;Black Pussy doesn't worry me, but I must
      confess that if there is any one I fear, it is Yowler the Bob Cat. Just
      thinking about him make me nervous. The more I tried not to think about
      him, the more I did think about him, and the more I thought about him, the
      more nervous I got. Then just before dark, on the bank of the Laughing
      Brook, I found some tracks in the mud. Those tracks were almost round, and
      that fact was enough to tell me who had made them. They were Yowler's
      footprints, and they hadn't been made very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, seeing those footprints made me more nervous than ever, and
      every time I saw a leaf move I jumped inside. My heart felt as if it were
      up in my throat most of the time. I had a feeling that Yowler wasn't far
      away. I hate that Cat! I hate the way he hunts! He goes sneaking about,
      without making a sound, or else he lies in wait, ready to spring without
      warning on the first one who happens along. A fellow never knows where to
      watch out for Yowler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent nearly all night sitting under a little hemlock tree with
      branches very close to the ground. I sat there because I didn't dare do
      anything else. As long as I stayed there I felt reasonably safe, because
      Yowler would have to find me, and to do that he would have to cross an
      open place where I could see him. I knew that if I went roaming about I
      might walk right into his clutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was lucky I had sense enough to stay there. You know the moon was very
      bright last night. It made that open place in front of where I was hiding
      almost as light as day. Once I closed my eyes for just a minute. When I
      opened them, there was Yowler sneaking across that open place. Where he
      had come from, I don't know. He hadn't made a sound. Not a leaf rustled
      under his big feet. Right in the middle of that open place, where the
      moonlight was brightest, he stopped to listen, and I simply held my
      breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us how he looked,&rdquo; prompted Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked just like what he is&mdash;a big Cat with a short tail,&rdquo;
       replied Jumper. &ldquo;Just to look at him any one would know he was own cousin
      to Black Pussy. He had a round head, rather long legs, and was about twice
      as big as Black Pussy. His feet looked big, even for him. On the tips of
      his ears were a few long black hairs. His coat was yellowish to
      reddish-brown, with dark spots on it. His chin and throat were white, and
      underneath he was white spotted with black. There were spots all down his
      legs. He didn't have enough of a tail to call it a tail. It was whitish on
      the under side and had black stripes on the upper side, and all the time
      he kept twitching it just the way Black Pussy twitches her tail when she
      is out hunting. All of a sudden he opened his mouth and gave such a yell
      that it is a wonder I didn't jump out of my skin. It frightened me so that
      I couldn't have moved if I had wanted to, which was a lucky thing for me.
      The instant he yelled he cocked his head on one side and listened. That
      yell must have wakened somebody and caused them to move, for Yowler turned
      suddenly and crept swiftly and without a sound out of sight. A minute
      later I heard a jump, and then I heard a fluttering. I think he caught one
      of the Grouse family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yelling that way is one of Yowler's tricks,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;He does it for the same reason Hooty the Owl hoots. He hopes that it will
      startle some sleeper so that they will move. If they do, his keen ears are
      sure to hear it. Was that all of your adventure, Jumper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jumper. &ldquo;I remained right where I was for the rest of the
      night. Just as daylight was beginning to steal through the Green Forest, I
      decided that it was safe to leave my hiding place and come over here.
      Half-way here I stopped for a few minutes in a thick clump of ferns. I was
      just about to start on again when I caught sight of something moving just
      back of an old stump. It was that foolish looking tail of Yowler's. Had he
      kept it still I wouldn't have seen him at all; but he was twitching it
      back and forth. He was crouched down close to the ground with all four
      feet drawn close together under him. There he crouched, and there I sat
      for the longest time. I didn't move, and he didn't move, save that foolish
      looking tail of his. I had begun to think that I would have to stay in
      that clump of ferns all day when suddenly Yowler sprang like a flash.
      There was a little squeak, and then I saw Yowler trot away with a Mouse in
      his mouth. I guess he must have seen that Mouse go in a hole and knew that
      if he waited long enough it would come out again. As soon as Yowler
      disappeared I hurried over here. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a splendid account of Yowler and his way of hunting,&rdquo; said Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;He does most of his hunting in just that way, sneaking
      about on the chance of surprising a Rabbit, Bird or Mouse, or else
      patiently watching and waiting beside a hole in which he knows some one
      has taken refuge. He hunts in the Green Forest exactly as Black Pussy,
      Farmer Brown's Cat, hunts Mice in the barn or Birds in the Old Orchard. In
      the spring Yowler destroys many eggs and young birds, not only those found
      in nests on the ground, but also those in nests in trees, for he is a
      splendid climber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yowler is found in nearly all of the swampy, brushy and wooded parts of
      the whole country, excepting in the great forests of the Far North, where
      his cousin Tufty the Lynx lives. Yowler is himself a Lynx, the Bay Lynx.
      In some places he is called simply Wild Cat. In others he is called the
      Catamount. He is not so fond of the thick forests as he is of swamps,
      brush-grown hillsides, old pastures and places where there are great
      masses of briars. Rocky ledges where there are caves in which to hide and
      plenty of brush also suit him. He is a coward, but when cornered will
      fight, though he will run from a little Dog half his size and take to a
      tree. In the South he is quite common and there often steals Chickens and
      Turkeys, even young Pigs. He prefers to hunt at night, but sometimes is
      seen in broad daylight. Mrs. Yowler's kittens are born in a cave or in a
      hollow tree. Despite the fact that he is an expert climber, Yowler spends
      most of his time on the ground and is one of the worst enemies of Rabbits,
      Mice, Squirrels and ground Birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the great forests of the Far North lives Yowler's cousin, Tufty the
      Canada Lynx, also called Loup Cervier and Lucivee. He is nearly a third
      larger than Yowler. From the tip of each ear long tufts of black hair
      stand up. On each side of his face is a ruff of long hair. His tail is
      even shorter than Yowler's, and the tip of it is always wholly black. His
      general color is gray, mottled with brown. His face ruff is white with
      black border. Yowler's feet are large, but Tufty's are immense for his
      size. This is because Tufty lives where the snow lies deep for many
      months, and these big, broad feet enable him to travel about on the snow
      without breaking through. He can travel with ease where Reddy Fox, not
      half his size and weight, would break through at every step. Tufty's ways
      are much like those of his cousin, Yowler, save that he is a dweller in
      the deep woods. Anything he can catch is food for Tufty, but his principal
      food is the Northern Hare. The color of his coat blends with the shadows
      so that he seems like a living shadow himself. In summer food is
      plentiful, and Tufty lives well, but in winder Tufty has hard work to get
      enough. Rarely does he know what a full stomach means then. Like Howler he
      can go a surprising length of time without food and still retain his
      strength. At that time of year he is a great traveler. He has to be, in
      order to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no fiercer looking animal in all the Green Forest than Tufty the
      Lynx, but despite this he is, like most Cats, cowardly. Only when cornered
      will he fight. He is possessed of a lively curiosity, and often he will
      stealthily follow a hunter or trapper for miles. The fur of his coat is
      very long and handsome, and he is hunted and trapped for this. As he lives
      for the most part far from the homes of men, he does less damage to man
      than does his cousin, Yowler the Bob Cat. Tufty must depend wholly for his
      living on the little people of the Green Forest. Sometimes he will attack
      a Fox. The pretty little spotted babies of Lightfoot the Deer are victims
      whenever he can find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The darker and deeper the Green Forest, the better Tufty likes it. He
      makes his den under great tangles of fallen trees or similar places. Mr.
      And Mrs. Tufty often hunt together, and in early winter the whole family
      often join in the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yowler and Tufty are the only members of the Cat family now found in the
      eastern part of the country. Formerly, their big cousin, Puma the Panther,
      lived in the East, but he has been so hunted by man that now he is found
      only in the mountains of the Far West and in a few of the wildest places
      in the South. I will tell you about him to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX Some Big and Little Cat Cousins
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Puma the Panther,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;is the largest member of the
      Cat family in this country, with the exception of one which is found only
      in the extreme Southwest. Puma is also called Mountain Lion, Cougar and
      Painter. You all know how Black Pussy looks. If Black Pussy could grow to
      be over eight feet long and be given a yellowish-brown coat, whitish
      underneath, she would look very much like Puma the Panther. Unlike Yowler
      the Bob Cat and Tufty the Lynx, Puma has a long tail&mdash;just such a
      round tail as Black Pussy has. Being so large, Puma is of great strength,
      and he has all the grace and quickness in movement of a true Cat. As I
      told you yesterday, there was a time when Puma lived in the East. In fact,
      he was once in nearly all parts of this great country where there were
      forests. But as the country became settled by man, Puma was driven out,
      and now his home is chiefly in the great mountains of the Far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being so big, he must have much food. Instead of depending for his living
      on small animals and birds, Puma hunts the large animals. He is so big and
      so strong that he can kill Lightfoot the Deer without trouble, and there
      is no one Lightfoot dreads more than Puma. He is especially fond of Horse
      flesh, and in certain sections where herds of Horses are pastured, he has
      killed so many young Horses that he has won the undying hate of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big as he is, he is a coward and will run from a barking Dog. When
      desperate with hunger, he has been known to attack man, but such occasions
      have been very, very rare. The fact is, he fears man and will slink sway
      at his approach. Like the true Cat that he is, he is wonderfully
      soft-footed and, despite his great size, moves silently. He makes his home
      among the ledges high up in the mountains. At night he goes forth to hunt.
      Once in a while he is seen hunting in daytime, but not often. Sometimes he
      may be seen basking in the sun, high up on the ledges. He is a good
      climber, like most Cats. He never shows himself boldly, but slinks about
      through the forest and among the rocks, the picture of stealth. This habit
      has won for him another name&mdash;that of Sneak Cat. Sometimes he sneaks
      up on his prey to within jumping distance. Again he lies in wait beside a
      path which certain animals are in the habit of using. He is capable of
      leaping a long distance, and when he strikes his prey his great weight,
      added to the force of his spring, is almost certain to knock it down, even
      though it be much bigger than Puma himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men hunt him with Dogs, for as I have already told you he will run from a
      barking Dog. Usually he doesn't run far before taking to a tree. The
      hunters follow and shoot him there. Were it not that he can be hunted in
      this way with Dogs, he would have little to fear from man, for he is so
      keen of sight and hearing and can move so swiftly and silently, that it is
      rarely man can surprise him. Sometimes he will follow a man just as Tufty
      the Lynx does, but usually for the same reason&mdash;curiosity. Despite
      the fact that he is a sneak and coward, he is so big and fierce-looking
      that he is feared by most men. Only those who really know him do not fear
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one other member of the Cat family in all this great land larger
      than Puma, and this is Jaguar, also called El Tigre. He is found only in a
      small part of the extreme Southwest, for he really belongs in the hot
      country to the south of this. Not only is he the largest, but he is the
      handsomest of all the Cat family. His coat is a beautiful deep yellow,
      covered with spots and rosettes of black. Beneath he is white with large
      black spots. He also has a fairly long tail. He is thick and heavy, and is
      not as long as Puma, but is stouter and heavier. He can kill Horses, Mules
      and Cattle with ease, but of course the principal part of his food
      consists of the wild animals about him. He is so savage in appearance that
      the mere sight of him always awakens fear. His method of hunting is much
      the same as that of the other members of the Cat family. Most of his
      hunting is done at night. While Puma the panther sometimes screams, Jaguar
      roars, and it is a very terrifying sound. All the little people and most
      of the big ones within hearing shiver when they hear it. Jaguar's head is
      large and he is tremendously strong in the jaws. Occasionally Jaguar is
      all black instead of being yellow and spotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this same part of the great Southwest lives a smaller cousin named
      Ocelot, often called Tiger Cat. Ocelot is only a little bigger than Black
      Pussy, whom you all know, and in shape is very like her. He also has a
      lovely coat. It is yellow, not a deep, rich yellow like Jaguar's, but a
      light yellow, thickly covered with black spots. On his cheeks and the back
      of his neck are black lines, and his tail is ringed with black. He likes
      best country where the brush is very thick and thorny, for there he can
      hunt in safety, with little fear of being hunted by man. Because of his
      smaller size, he lives chiefly on small animals, birds and reptiles. He
      sometimes kills and eats big Snakes. When he happens to live near man, he
      robs the Hen roosts just as Yowler does. In all his ways he is like the
      other members of the Cat family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A neighbor of his in that same country is the queerest looking member of
      the Cat family. He is called the Jaguarundi Cat or Eyra. Sometimes he is
      dressed in dull gray and sometimes in rusty red. His body is shaped more
      like that of Little Joe Otter than of any one else, and he has short legs
      and a long tail. He is a little larger than Little Joe, and his head is
      rather small and somewhat flattened, not so round as the heads of most of
      the other members of the Cat family. He likes to be in the vicinity of
      water and is a good swimmer. Not very much is known by man about his
      habits, but he is a true Cat, and the habits of all Cats are much the
      same.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI Bobby Coon Arrives
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature was just about to open school when a slight noise up the
      Lone Little Path drew all eyes in that direction. There, shuffling down
      the Lone Little Path, was a queer looking fellow. No one needed more than
      one look at that funny, sharp, black and white face of his to recognize
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby Coon!&rdquo; shouted Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;Are you coming to join our school,
      Bobby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby shuffled along a little nearer, then sat up and blinked at them
      sleepily. No one needed to be told that Bobby had been out all night. He
      rubbed his eyes and yawned. &ldquo;Hello, everybody,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I wish I felt as
      bright and lively as all of you look. I'd like to join your school, but
      I'm afraid if I did I would go to sleep right in the middle of the lesson.
      I ought to have been home an hour ago. So I guess I'll have to be
      excused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature pointed an accusing finger at Bobby Coon. &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; said
      she, &ldquo;You've been getting in mischief. Now own up you've been stealing
      some of that sweet, milky corn from Farmer Brown's cornfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby Coon hung his head. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I don't think it was stealing,&rdquo;
       he mumbled. &ldquo;That corn just grows, and I don't see why I shouldn't have my
      share of it. I help myself to other things, so why shouldn't I help myself
      to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you why,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Farmer Brown planted that
      corn and took care of it. If he hadn't planted it, there wouldn't have
      been any corn there. That makes it his corn. If it grew wild, you would
      have a perfect right to it. As it is, you haven't any right to it at all.
      Now take my advice, Bobby, and keep away from that cornfield. If you
      don't, you will get in trouble. One of these fine nights Bowser the Hound
      will find you there and you will have to run for your life. Keep away from
      temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that corn is so good,&rdquo; sighed Bobby Coon, smacking his lips. &ldquo;There
      is nothing I like better than sweet, milky corn, and if I don't get it
      from Farmer Brown's cornfield, I can't get it at all, for it doesn't grow
      wild. He'll never miss the little I take.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head and looked very grave. &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;that is no excuse at all. Mark what I say: If you keep on you certainly
      will get in trouble. If you would be satisfied to take just an ear or two,
      I don't believe Farmer Brown would care, but you know very well that you
      spoil many times what you eat. You sample one ear, then think that
      probably the next ear will be better and sweeter and you try that. By the
      time you get through you have spoiled a lot, and eaten only a little. I
      think I'll punish you a little myself by keeping you here a while. If you
      think you can't keep awake, just go over and sit down there by Prickly
      Porky; he'll keep you awake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I can keep awake,&rdquo; stammered Bobby and opened his eyes
      very wide as if he were trying to stretch his eyelids so as to make them
      stay open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll help you by asking you a few questions,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;Who is it that people sometimes call you the little cousin of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby grinned. &ldquo;Buster Bear,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, being a Raccoon, you are not a Bear, but you are related to
      the Bear family. I want you all to notice Bobby's footprints over yonder.
      You will see that the print of his hind foot shows the whole foot, heels
      and toes, and is a lot like Buster Bear's footprint on a small scale.
      Bobby shuffles along in much the same way that Buster walks. No one ever
      mistakes Bobby Coon for any one else. There is no danger that any one ever
      will as long as he carries that big, bushy tail with its broad black and
      gray rings. There is only one other in all this great country with a tail
      so marked, and that is a relative of Bobby's of whom I will tell you
      later. And there is no other face like Bobby's with its black cheeks. You
      will notice that Bobby is rather small around the shoulders, but is big
      and heavy around the hips. That gives him a clumsy look, but he is
      anything but clumsy. Despite the fact that his legs are not very long
      Bobby is a very good runner. However, he doesn't do any running unless he
      has to. Bobby, where were you before you went over to Farmer Brown's
      cornfield?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Bobby hung his head. It was quite clear that Bobby didn't want
      to answer that question. But Old Mother Nature insisted, and finally Bobby
      blurted it out. &ldquo;I was up to Farmer Brown's hen house,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, just to look around,&rdquo; replied Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To look around for what?&rdquo; insisted Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bobby, &ldquo;I thought one of those Hens up there might have
      dropped an egg that she didn't really care about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature sternly, &ldquo;why don't you own up that you
      went over there to try to steal eggs? Or did you think you might catch a
      tender young Chicken? Where were you night before last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over at the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool,&rdquo; replied Bobby promptly,
      evidently glad the subject had been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you didn't find sweet corn or eggs or Chickens over there, did
      you?&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I caught three of the sweetest tasting little fish in a little
      pool in the Laughing Brook, and I got some of the tenderest Clams I've
      ever eaten,&rdquo; replied Bobby, smacking his lips. &ldquo;I raked them out of the
      mud and opened them. Down at the Smiling Pool I had a lot of fun catching
      young Frogs. I certainly do like Frogs. It is great sport to catch them,
      and they are fine eating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you have had an eye on the beech trees and the wild
      grape-vines,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby's face brightened. &ldquo;Indeed I have,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There will be splendid
      crops of beechnuts and grapes this fall. My, but they will taste good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;There is small danger that you will go
      hungry,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;When you can't find enough to eat times must be very
      hard indeed. For the benefit of the others you might add that in addition
      to the things mentioned you eat other fruits, including berries, insects
      of various kinds, birds when you can catch them, Mice, Turtles, in fact
      almost anything that can be eaten. You are not at all fussy about the kind
      of food. But you have one habit in regard to your food which it would be
      well if some of these other little folks followed. Do you know what it
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not unless you mean the habit I have
      of washing my food. If there is any water near, I always like to take what
      I am going to eat over to it and wash it; somehow it tastes better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;More than once I've seen you in the
      moonlight beside the Laughing Brook washing your food, and it has always
      pleased me, for there is nothing like cleanliness and neatness. Did you
      raise a family this year, Bobby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Coon did. We had four of the finest youngsters you have ever seen
      over in a certain big hollow tree. They are getting big and lively now,
      and go out with their mother every night. I do hope the hunters will leave
      them alone this fall. I hate to think of anything happening to them. If
      they can just get through the hunting season safely, I'll enjoy my winter
      sleep better, and I know Mrs. Coon will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Johnny Chuck pricked up his ears. &ldquo;Do you sleep all winter,
      Bobby?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all winter, but a good part of it,&rdquo; replied Bobby. &ldquo;I don't turn in
      until the weather gets pretty cold, and it is hard to find anything to
      eat. But after the first snow I'm usually ready to sleep. Then I curl up
      in a warm bed of leaves in a certain big hollow tree, and don't care how
      cold or stormy the weather is. Sometimes I wake up once or twice, when the
      weather is mild, and take a little walk around for exercise. But I don't
      go far and soon return to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do when Bowser the Hound gets after you?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run till I get out of breath,&rdquo; replied Bobby. &ldquo;And if by that time I
      haven't been able to fool him so that he loses my trail, I take to a tree.
      Thank goodness, he can't climb a tree. Sometimes I climb from the top of
      one tree into the top of another, and sometimes into a third and then a
      fourth, when they are near enough together. That fools the hunters, if
      they follow Bowser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any relatives, Bobby?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know I had until you mentioned that fellow with the ringed tail
      you said you would tell us about. I didn't know there was anybody with a
      tail like mine, and I would like to know about it,&rdquo; replied Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't exactly a Raccoon, but he is more nearly related to you than any
      one else,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;His tail shows that. Aside from
      this, he is nothing like you at all. He is called the Ring-tailed Cat. But
      he doesn't look any more like a Cat than he does like you, and he isn't
      related to the Cat family at all. He has several names. He is called the
      Bassaris, the Civet Cat, Ring-tailed Cat, Coon Cat and Cacomixtle. Instead
      of being thick and clumsy-looking, as is Bobby here, he is long and rather
      slender, with a yellowish-brown coat, somewhat grayish on the back and
      whitish underneath. His head is rather small, long and beautifully shaped.
      His ears are of good size and very pretty. In some ways he looks like
      Reddy Fox. But the really beautiful thing about him is his tail. It is
      nearly as long as his body, thick and beautifully marked with black and
      white bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is quick and graceful in his movements, and, like Bobby, prefers to be
      abroad at night. Also, like Bobby, he eats about everything that he can
      find&mdash;flesh, reptiles, fruit, nuts and insects. He lives in the Far
      Southwest, and also in some of the mountains of the Far West. Why he
      should be called Civet Cat is more than I can guess, for he is neither a
      Civet nor a Cat. He is very clever at catching Mice, and sometimes he is
      kept as a pet, just as Farmer Brown keeps Black Pussy, to catch the Mice
      about the homes of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Bobby, you can trot along home, and I hope all that green corn you
      have eaten will not give you the stomach ache. To-morrow we will see what
      we can find out about Buster Bear.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII Buster Bear Nearly Breaks Up School
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Buster Bear a tail?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature, and her eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; declared Whitefoot the Wood Mouse promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; contradicted Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say, Prickly Porky?&rdquo; Old Mother Nature asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he has any; if he has, I've never seen it,&rdquo; said Prickly
      Porky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because you've got poor eyes,&rdquo; spoke up Jumper the Hare. &ldquo;He
      certainly has a tail. It isn't much of a one, but it is a tail. I know
      because I've seen it many times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woof, woof,&rdquo; said a deep, rumbly, grumbly voice. &ldquo;What's going on here?
      Who is it hasn't any tail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice it looked for a few
      minutes as if school would be broken up for that day. There was the same
      mad scrambling to get away that there had been the morning Reddy Fox
      unexpectedly appeared. However, there was this difference: When Reddy
      appeared, most of the little people sought safe hiding places, but now
      they merely ran to safe distances, and there turned to stare with awe and
      great respect at the owner of that deep, rumbly, grumbly voice. It was
      great, big Buster Bear himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buster stood up on his hind legs, like a man, and his small eyes, for they
      are small for his size, twinkled with fun as he looked around that awe
      filled circle. &ldquo;Don't let me interrupt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I heard about this
      school and I thought I would just pay a friendly visit. There is nothing
      for you to fear. I have just had my breakfast and I couldn't eat another
      mouthful to save me, not even such a tender morsel as Whitefoot the Wood
      Mouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whitefoot hurriedly ran a little farther away, and Buster Bear chuckled.
      Then he looked over at Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Won't you tell them that I'm
      the best-natured and most harmless fellow in all the Great World?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;That depends on the condition of your stomach,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;If it is as full as you say it is, and I know you wouldn't tell
      me an untruth, not even timid Whitefoot has anything to fear from you.&rdquo;
       Then she told all the little people to put aside their fears and return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buster, seeing that some of the more timid were still fearful, backed off
      a short distance and sat down on his haunches. &ldquo;What was that about a tail
      I overheard as I came up?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a little discussion as to whether or not you have a tail,&rdquo; replied
      Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Some say you have, and some say you haven't. Whitefoot
      thinks you haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Buster Bear chuckled way down deep in his throat. &ldquo;Whitefoot
      never in his life looked at me long enough to know whether I've got a tail
      or not,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I never yet have seen him until now, when he wasn't
      running away as fast as his legs could take him. So with me always behind
      him, how could he tell whether or not I have a tail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you?&rdquo; demanded Peter Rabbit bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; asked Buster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;But if you have you are sitting down on
      it and I can't tell. It can't be much of a one, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Buster chuckled. &ldquo;Quite right, Peter; quite right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I've
      got a tail, but hardly enough of a one to really call it a tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Buster sat there, every one had a splendid chance to see just how he
      looked. His coat was all black; in fact he was black all over, with the
      exception of his nose, which was brown. His fur was long and rather
      shaggy. His ears were round. His paws were big and armed with strong,
      wicked looking claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all see what a black coat Buster has,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now
      I'm going to tell you something which may surprise you. Just as there are
      Red Foxes that are black, so there are Black Bears that are brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; grunted Buster, with the funniest look of surprise on his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fact, Buster,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;A great many of your
      family live out in the mountains of the Far West, and there quite often
      there will be one who is all brown. People used to think that these brown
      Bears were a different kind of Bear, and called them Cinnamon Bears. It
      was a long, long time before it was found out that those brown Bears are
      really black Bears. Sometimes one of the twin babies will be all black and
      the other all brown. Sometimes one of Buster's family will have a white
      spot on his breast. Buster's branch of the family is found in nearly all
      of the wooded parts of the entire country. In the Sunny South they live in
      the swamps and do not grow as big as in the North. Buster, there is a soft
      spot on the ground; I want you to walk across it so that these little
      folks can see your footprints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good-naturedly Buster dropped on all fours and walked across the soft
      spot. Right away every one understood why Old Mother Nature had asked
      Buster to do this. The prints of his hind feet were very like the prints
      of Farmer Brown's boy when barefooted, only of course very much larger.
      You see, they showed the print of the heel as well as the rest of the
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;Buster puts his whole foot on the
      ground, while all members of the Dog and Cat families walk wholly on their
      toes. Animals that put the whole foot down are called plantigrade. How big
      do you think Buster was when he was born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm only guessing,&rdquo; said Chatterer the Red Squirrel, &ldquo;but he is
      such a big fellow that I think he must have been a bouncing big baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature smiled. &ldquo;I don't wonder you think so,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The
      fact is, however, Buster was a very tiny and very helpless little chap. He
      was just about the size of one of Prickly Porky's babies. He was no bigger
      than a Rat. He was born in the middle of winter and didn't get his eyes
      open for forty days. It was two months before he poked his head outside
      the den in which he was born, to find out what the Great World was like.
      At that time he wasn't much bigger than Peter Rabbit, and he and his twin
      sister were as lively a pair of youngsters and as full of mischief as any
      Bears the Green Forest has ever seen. You might tell us, Buster, what you
      live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buster's eyes snapped. &ldquo;I live on anything I can eat, and I can eat most
      everything. I suppose a lot of people think I live almost wholly on the
      little people who are my neighbors, but that is a mistake. I do catch Mice
      when I am lucky enough to find them where I can dig them out, and they
      certainly are good eating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Whitefoot the Wood Mouse and Danny Meadow Mouse hastily scurried
      farther away, and Buster's eyes twinkled with mischief. &ldquo;Of course I don't
      mind a Rabbit either, if I am lucky enough to catch one,&rdquo; said he, and
      Peter Rabbit quickly backed off a few steps. &ldquo;In fact I like meat of any
      kind,&rdquo; continued Buster. &ldquo;But the greater part of my food isn't meat at
      all. In the spring I dig up roots of different kinds, and eat tender grass
      shoots and some bark and twigs from young trees. When the insects appear
      they help out wonderfully. I am very fond of Ants. I pull over all the old
      logs and tear to pieces all the old stumps I can find, and lick up the
      Ants and their eggs that I am almost sure to find there. Almost any kind
      of insect tastes good to me if there are enough of them. I love to find
      and dig open the nests of Wasps that make their homes in the ground, and
      of course I suppose you all know that there is nothing in the world I like
      better than honey. If I can find a Bee nest I am utterly happy. For the
      sake of the honey, I am perfectly willing to stand all the stinging the
      Bees can give me. I like fish and I love to hunt Frogs. When the berry
      season begins, I just feast. In the fall I get fat on beechnuts and
      acorns. The fact is, there isn't much I don't like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been told you sleep all winter,&rdquo; said Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends on the winter,&rdquo; replied Buster Bear. &ldquo;I don't go to sleep
      until I have to. I don't have to as long as I can find enough to eat. If
      the winter begins early, with bad weather, I make a comfortable bed of
      leaves in a cave or under a big pile of fallen trees or even in a hollow
      log, if I can find one big enough. Then I go to sleep for the rest of the
      winter. But if the winter is mild and open and there is a chance of
      finding anything to eat, I sleep only in the really bad weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you try to get fat before going to sleep, the way I do?&rdquo; asked Johnny
      Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buster grinned. &ldquo;Yes, Johnny, I try,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and usually I succeed. You
      see, I need to be fat in order to keep warm and also to have something to
      live on in the spring, just the same as you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been told that you can climb, but as I don't live in the Green
      Forest I have never seen you climb. I should think it would be slow work
      for such a big fellow as you to climb a tree,&rdquo; said Johnny Chuck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buster looked up at Happy Jack Squirrel and winked. Then he walked over to
      the tree in which Happy Jack was sitting, stood up and suddenly began to
      scramble up the tree. There was nothing slow about the way Buster Bear
      went up that tree. Happy Jack squealed with sudden fright and started for
      the top of that tree as only Happy Jack can climb. Then he made a flying
      jump to the next tree. Halfway up Buster stopped. Then he began to come
      down. He came down tail first. When he was within ten feet of the ground
      he simply let go and dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that just to show you how I get out of a tree when I am really in a
      hurry,&rdquo; explained Buster. &ldquo;I don't climb trees much now unless it is for
      honey, but when I was a little fellow I used to love to climb trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Buster sat up very straight and pointed his nose up in the wind.
      An anxious look crept into his face. He cocked his ears as if listening
      with all his might. That is just what he was doing. Presently he dropped
      down to all fours. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I think I had better be going.
      Farmer Brown is coming down the Lone Little Path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buster turned and disappeared at a speed that was simply astonishing in
      such a clumsy-looking fellow. Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;Buster's eyes
      are not very good,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but there is nothing the matter with his
      nose or with his ears. If Buster says that Farmer Brown is coming down the
      Lone Little Path, there is no doubt that he is, although he may be some
      distance away yet. Buster has been smart enough to learn that he has every
      reason to fear man, and he promptly takes himself out of the way at the
      first hint that man is near. It is a funny thing, but most men are as
      afraid of Buster as Buster is of them, and they haven't the least need of
      being afraid at all. Where man is concerned there isn't one of you little
      people more timid than Buster Bear. The faintest smell of man will make
      him run. If he should be wounded or cornered, he would fight. Mrs. Bear
      would fight to protect her babies, but these are the only conditions under
      which a Black Bear will face a man. You think Buster is big, and he is,
      but Buster has relatives very much bigger than he. He has one beside whom
      he would look actually small. I'll tell you a little about these cousins
      of Buster.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII Buster Bear's Big Cousins
    </h2>
    <p>
      Buster Bear had been right about the coming of Farmer Brown. It was only a
      few minutes after Buster's disappearance that Farmer Brown's footsteps
      were heard coming down the Lone Little Path, and of course that ended
      school for that morning. But the next morning all were on hand again at
      sun-up, for every one wanted to hear about Buster Bear's big cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way out in the mountains of the Far West, where Whistler the Marmot and
      Little Chief the Pika live, is a big cousin of Buster Bear,&rdquo; began Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is Silvertip the Grizzly Bear, and in the past no
      animal in all this great country was so feared by man, as he. But times
      have changed, and Silvertip has been so hunted with terrible guns that he
      has learned to fear man quite as much as Buster does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is larger than Buster and possessed of tremendous strength. Instead of
      a black coat, he has a coat which varies from yellowish-brown to almost
      black. The tips of the hairs usually are lighter, giving him a frosted
      appearance, and this is what has given him his name. His claws are longer
      and more curved than those of Buster; in fact those claws are so big that
      they look very terrible. Because they are so long, Silvertip cannot climb
      trees. But if they prevent him climbing trees they are the finest kind of
      tools for digging out Marmots and ground Squirrels. Even when Whistler the
      Marmot makes his home down in among the rocks, he is not safe. Silvertip's
      strength is so great that he can pull over and roll aside great rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a great traveler and covers a wide range of country in his search
      for food. Sometimes he visits the Cattle ranges and kills Cattle. So great
      is his strength that he can kill a Cow with ease. Clumsy looking as he is,
      he is a very fast runner, and only a fast Horse can outrun him. Like
      Buster, he lives on anything he can find that is eatable. He has been so
      hunted by man that he has become very cunning, and in all the great
      mountains where he lives there is no one with quicker wits. At certain
      seasons of the year great numbers of a fish called Salmon come up the
      rivers in that country, and then Silvertip lives high. He watches beside a
      pool until a Salmon swims within reach; then, with a swift movement of one
      paw, he scoops the fish on to the bank. Or he finds a place where the
      water is so shallow that the fish have difficulty in getting across, and
      there he seizes them as they struggle up the river. In winter he sleeps
      just as Buster does, usually in a well-hidden cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Silvertip is a splendid mother. Usually the cubs, of which as a rule
      there are two, remain with her until they are a year old. Both Buster Bear
      and Silvertip have a queer habit of standing up against a tree and biting
      it as high up as they can reach. The next Bear who comes along that way
      sees the mark and makes his own on the same tree. Silvertip knows every
      inch of that part of the country in which he lives and always picks out
      the best way of getting from one place to another. He is one of the finest
      animals in this country, and it is a matter for sadness that his splendid
      race will soon come to an end unless man makes laws to protect him from
      the hunters. In very many places where he used to be found he lives no
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silvertip is not so good-natured as Buster, but all he asks is to be left
      alone. Of course when he turns Cattle killer he is getting into the worst
      possible kind of mischief and man cannot be blamed for hunting him. But it
      is only now and then that one of Silvertip's family turns Cattle killer.
      The others do no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you yesterday that Buster Bear has one cousin beside whom he would
      look small. This is Bigfoot the Alaska or Great Brown Bear, who lives in
      the extreme northwest part of the continent. Even Silvertip would look
      small beside him. He is a giant, the largest flesh-eating animal in all
      the great world. His coat is dark brown. When he stands up on his hind
      legs, he is almost half again as tall as a tall man. He stands very high
      at the shoulders and his head is very large. Like the other members of the
      Bear family, he eats all sorts of things. He hunts for Mice and other
      small animals, digs up roots, stuffs himself with berries, and at times
      grazes on a kind of wild grass, just as Cattle might do. He is a great
      fish eater, for fish are very plentiful in the streams in the country
      where he lives. Big as he is, he has learned to fear man just as Silvertip
      has. Occasionally when surprised he has been known to attack man and kill
      him, but as a rule he will run at the first hint of man's approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last of the Bear cousins is Snow King the Polar Bear. Snow King is
      king of the Frozen North. He lives in the region of snow and ice, and his
      coat is all white. He also is a big Bear, and of somewhat different shape
      from his cousins. He is longer, and has a much longer neck and a long
      head. His ears are rather small and close to his head. Snow King lives the
      year round where it would seem that no animal could live, and he manages
      to live well. Though his home is in the coldest part of the Great World,
      he does not mind the cold at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than any other member of the Bear family, Snow King is a flesh
      eater. This is because only in certain places, and then only for a few
      weeks in midsummer, is there any plant life. He is a great fisherman, and
      fish furnish him a great deal of his food. In that far northern country
      are great numbers of animals who live in the ocean, but come ashore to
      rest and bask in the sun, and to have their babies there. They are Seals,
      Sea Lions and Walruses. I will tell you about them later. On these Snow
      King depends for much of his food. He is himself a wonderful swimmer, and
      often swims far out in the icy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there there are great fields of floating ice, and Snow King swims from
      one to another in search of Seals, for they often climb out on these ice
      fields, just as they do on shore. Sometimes Mrs. Bear takes her cubs for
      long swims. When they become tired, one will climb on her back, and the
      other will seize her tail, so she will carry one and tow the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow King's babies are born in a house of snow. Early in the winter Mrs.
      Bear finds a sheltered place where the snow will drift over her. There she
      goes to sleep, and the snow drifts and drifts over her until she is buried
      deep. You might think she would be cold, but she isn't, for the snow keeps
      her warm. Her breath melts a little hole up through the snow, so that she
      always has air. There the babies are born, and there they remain, just as
      Buster Bear's remain in their home, until they are big enough to follow
      their mother about. Then she breaks her way out in the spring, and leads
      her cubs forth to teach them how to take care of themselves. Snow King,
      himself, does not sleep through the winter, but roams about, just as in
      the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snow King is fearless and has not yet learned to dread man, as have his
      cousins. He will not hesitate to attack man and is terrible to meet at
      close quarters. Because he lives in that far, cold country, he is not
      hunted as much as other bears are. Besides the Seals and fish, he
      sometimes catches an Arctic Hare. In the summer great numbers of Ducks and
      other sea birds nest in that far northern country, and their eggs and
      young add to Snow King's bill of fare. His white coat is so in keeping
      with his surroundings that it is of the greatest aid to him in his
      hunting. It is a very beautiful coat and makes him the most beautiful of
      all the Bear family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this is all about the Bears, and also it is all about the order of
      flesh eaters, or Carnivora. I think that next we will see what we can find
      out about a certain little friend of yours, who, though he eats flesh, is
      not a member of the flesh-eating order at all, but belongs to an order of
      which he is the only member in this country. I will leave you to guess who
      it is.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV Unc' Billy and Old Mrs. Possum
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the way home from school Peter Rabbit did his best to think who it
      could be who ate flesh, yet wasn't a member of the order of flesh eaters.
      Every few hops he would stop to think, but all his stopping and all his
      thinking were in vain, and when he started for school the next morning he
      was as puzzled as ever. On his way through the Green Forest he passed a
      certain tree. He was just past and no more when a familiar voice hailed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning, Bre'r Rabbit,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;What's yo' hurry?&rdquo; Peter stopped
      abruptly and looked up in that tree. There, peering down at him from a
      hole high up in the trunk, was a sharp, whitish-gray face, with a pair of
      twinkling black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Unc' Billy,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;How are you and Ol' Mrs. Possum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Po'ly, Peter, Po'ly. We-uns haven't had breakfast yet, so we-uns are
      feeling po'ly,&rdquo; replied Unc' Billy with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thought popped into Peter's head. &ldquo;Unc' Billy,&rdquo; cried Peter
      excitedly, &ldquo;are you a Carnivora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unc' poked his head a little farther out and put his hand behind his ear
      as if he were a little hard of hearing. &ldquo;What's that, Bre'r Rabbit? Am I a
      what?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Carnivora?&rdquo; repeated Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah reckons Ah might be if Ah knew what it was, but as long as Ah don't,
      Ah reckons I ain't,&rdquo; retorted Unc' Billy. &ldquo;Ah reckons Ah'm just plain
      Possum. When Ah wants to be real uppity, Ah puts on an 'o.' Then Ah am
      Mister Opossum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Peter wasn't listening. The fact is, Peter had started
      lipperty-lipperty-lip for school, without even being polite enough to say
      good-by. He arrived at school quite out of breath. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I
      know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know who it is who eats flesh, yet doesn't belong to the order of flesh
      eaters. It's Unc' Billy Possum!&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;However did you find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't exactly find it out; I guessed it,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;On my way
      here I saw Unc' Billy, and it popped into my head right away that he was
      one we haven't heard about, and must be the one. But if he eats flesh, I
      don't see why he isn't a member of the order of flesh eaters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is because he belongs to a group which has something which makes them
      entirely different from all other animals, and for this reason they have
      been given an order of their own,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;They
      belong to the order of Marsupials, which means pouched animals. It is
      because the mothers have big pockets in which they carry their babies. Old
      Mrs. Possum has just such a pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;I've seen those babies poking their heads
      out of that pocket. They look too funny for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Opossums are the only Marsupials in this country,&rdquo; continued Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;Now have I made it quite clear why, although they eat
      flesh, Unc' Billy and Ol' Mrs. Possum are not members of the same big
      order as Buster Bear and the other flesh eaters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody nodded. Just then Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted, &ldquo;Here
      comes Unc' Billy, Ol' Mrs. Possum and all the little Possums.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, down the Lone Little Path came the Possum family, and a funny
      looking sight they were. Unc' Billy was whitish-gray, his face whiter than
      the rest of him. He looked as if he had just gotten out of bed and
      forgotten to brush his hair; it pointed every which way. His legs were
      dark, his feet black and his toes white. His ears were without any hair at
      all, and were black for the lower half, the rest being white. He had a
      long whitish tail without any hair on it. Altogether, with his sharp face
      and naked tail, he looked a great deal as though he might be a giant Rat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Unc' Billy was a funny-looking fellow, Ol' Mrs. Possum was even
      more funny-looking. She seemed to have heads and tails all over her. You
      see, she had brought along her family, and Ol' Mrs. Possum is one of those
      who believe in large families. There were twelve youngsters, and they were
      exactly like their parents, only small. They were clinging all over Ol'
      Mrs. Possum. Some were on her back, some were clinging to her sides, and a
      couple were in the big pocket, where they had spent their babyhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;all done thought we'd come to school,&rdquo; explained Unc' Billy with
      a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you did,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You see, the rest of your
      friends here are a little curious about the Possum family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Ol' Mrs. Possum was climbing a tree, and when she had reached a
      comfortable crotch the little Possums left her and began to play about in
      the tree. It was then that it appeared what handy things those naked
      little tails were. When the little Possums crawled out where the branches
      were small, they simply wrapped their tails around the twigs to keep from
      falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Those certainly are handy tails.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Handiest tails ever was,&rdquo; declared Unc' Billy. &ldquo;Don't know what Ah ever
      would do without mah tail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you climb a tree, Unc' Billy, and show your friends here how you
      manage to get the eggs from a nest that you cannot reach by crawling along
      the branch on which it is placed,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unc' Billy grinned, and good-naturedly started up a tree. He crept out on
      a branch that overhung another branch. Way out where the branch was small
      crept Unc' Billy. Then he wrapped the end of his tail around the branch
      and swung himself off, keeping hold of the branch only with his tail and
      one hind foot. Then, stretching down full length, he could just reach the
      branch below him. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;if there was a nest on this
      branch down here, Ah could get those eggs without any trouble. Ah wish
      there was a nest. Just speaking of eggs makes mah mouth water.&rdquo; Again Unc'
      Billy grinned and then pulled himself back to the other branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature shook her head reprovingly. &ldquo;Unc' Billy,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you
      are a bad old rascal to steal eggs. What's more, it doesn't matter to you
      much whether you find eggs or young birds in a nest. It is a wonder that
      between you and Chatterer the Red Squirrel any of the birds succeed in
      raising families around here. Have you visited Farmer Brown's hen house
      lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unc' Billy shook his head. &ldquo;Not lately,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;Ah done got a dreadful
      scare the last time Ah was up there, and Ah reckons Ah'll stay away from
      there for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else do you eat?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; replied Unc' Billy. &ldquo;Ah reckons Ah ain't no ways particular&mdash;insects,
      roots, Frogs, Toads, small Snakes, Lizards, berries, fruits, nuts, young
      Rats and Mice, corn, any old meat that has been left lying around. Ah
      reckon Ah could find a meal most any time most anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you always have as big a family as you have there?&rdquo; asked Peter
      Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; replied Unc' Billy. &ldquo;But sometimes Mrs. Possum has to tote
      around a still bigger family. We believe in chillun and lots of them. We
      reckon on havin' two or three big families every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo; asked Johnny Chuck. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit.
      &ldquo;It's up in a big hollow tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unc' Billy looked down at Peter. &ldquo;'Tisn't at all necessary to tell anybody
      where that hollow tree is, Bre'r Rabbit,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are Possums found anywhere except around here?&rdquo; inquired Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;They are found all down through
      the Sunny South, and in the warmer parts of the Middle West. Unc' Billy
      and his relatives are not fond of cold weather. They prefer to be where
      they can be reasonably warm all the year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some folks think Unc' Billy isn't smart, but those folks don't know Unc'
      Billy. He learned a long time ago that he can't run as fast as some
      others, so he has learned to depend on his wits in time of danger. What do
      you think he does?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; cried Peter; &ldquo;I saw him do it once. Farmer Brown's boy surprised
      Unc' Billy, and Unc' Billy just fell right over dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! That's a story, Peter Rabbit. How could Unc' Billy have fallen over
      dead and be alive up in that tree this very minute?&rdquo; cried Happy Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean he was really dead, but that he looked as if he were dead,&rdquo;
       explained Peter. &ldquo;And he did, too. He was the deadest looking thing I ever
      saw. I thought he was dead myself. I was watching from a bramble tangle
      where I was hiding, and I certainly thought the life had been scared right
      out of Unc' Billy. I guess Farmer Brown's boy thought so too. He picked
      Unc' Billy up by the tail, and looked him all over, and said, 'You poor
      little thing. I didn't mean to hurt you.' Unc' Billy didn't so much as
      wink an eye. Farmer Brown's boy went off up the path carrying Unc' Billy
      by the tail. By and by he laid Unc' Billy down on an old stump while he
      went to look at a nest of Blacky the Crow. When he came back Unc' Billy
      wasn't there. I never did see Unc' Billy hurry as he did the minute Farmer
      Brown's boy's back was turned. He came to life as suddenly as he had
      dropped dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Peter,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;Some other smart little
      people try that trick sometimes, but none of them can do it as well as
      Unc' Billy Possum. Pretending to be dead in order to remain alive is the
      cleverest thing Unc' Billy does. Now how about Lightfoot the Deer for the
      next lesson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; cried all together and prepared to start for their homes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV Lightfoot, Blacktail and Forkhorn
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all the people who live in the Green Forest none is more admired than
      Lightfoot the Deer. So perhaps you can guess how delighted every one was
      when, just as the morning lesson was to begin, Lightfoot himself stepped
      daintily out from a thicket and bowed to Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that my little friends here are to learn something
      about my family this morning, and thought you would not mind if I joined
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter Rabbit forgetting that Lightfoot had
      spoken to Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      All laughed, even Old Mother Nature. You see, Peter was so very much in
      earnest, and at the same time so excited, that it really was funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter has spoken for all of us,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;You are more
      than welcome, Lightfoot. I had intended to send for you, but it slipped my
      mind. I am delighted to have you here and I know that the others are. I
      suspect you will be most comfortable if you lie down, but before you do
      this I want everybody to have a good look at you. Just stand for a few
      minutes in that little open space where all can see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lightfoot walked over to the open space where the sun fell full on him and
      there he stood, a picture of grace and beauty with just enough honest
      pride in his appearance to give him an air of noble dignity. There was
      more than one little gasp of admiration among his little neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;is one of the most beautiful of all my
      children, and the knowledge that he is beautiful does not spoil him.
      Lightfoot belongs to the Deer family, as you all know, and this in turn is
      in the order called Ungulata, which means hoofed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit abruptly sat up, and his ears stood up like exclamation
      points. &ldquo;Farmer Brown's cows have those funny feet called hoofs; are they
      related to Lightfoot?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to another family, but it is in the same order. So they are
      distant cousins of Lightfoot,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Farmer Brown's Pigs, what about them?&rdquo; asked Chatterer the Red
      Squirrel. &ldquo;They also belong to that order and so are related,&rdquo; explained
      Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; exclaimed Chatterer. &ldquo;If I were in Lightfoot's place I never, never
      would acknowledge any such homely, stupid creatures as those as relatives
      of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget that Prickly Porky the Porcupine and Robber the Rat are
      members of the same order to which you belong,&rdquo; retorted Old Mother Nature
      softly, and Chatterer hung his head. &ldquo;Lightfoot,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is the
      White-tailed or Virginia Deer, and is in some ways the most beautiful of
      the Deer family. You have only to look at him to know that those slim legs
      of his are meant for speed. He can go very fast, but not for long
      distances without stopping. Like Peter Rabbit he is a jumper rather than a
      true runner, and travels with low bounds with occasional high ones when
      alarmed. He can make very long and high jumps, and this is one reason he
      prefers to live in the Green Forest where there are fallen trees and
      tangles of old logs. If frightened he can leap over them, whereas his
      enemies must crawl under or climb over or go around them. Ordinary fences,
      such as Farmer Brown has built around his fields, do not bother Lightfoot
      in the least. He can leap over them as easily as Peter Rabbit can jump
      over that little log he is sitting beside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now, because it is summer, Lightfoot's coat is decidedly reddish in
      color and very handsome. But in winter it is wholly different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; spoke up Chatterer the Red Squirrel. &ldquo;It is gray then. I've
      often seen Lightfoot in winter, and there isn't a red hair on him at that
      season.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; agreed Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;His red coat is for summer only.
      Notice that Lightfoot has a black nose. That is, the tip of it is black.
      Beneath his chin is a black spot. A band across his nose, the inside of
      each ear and a circle around each eye is whitish. His throat is white and
      he is white beneath. Now, Peter, you are so interested in tails, tell me
      without looking what color Lightfoot's tail is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White, snowy white,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly. &ldquo;I suppose that is why he is
      called the White-tailed Deer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Johnny Chuck who happened to be sitting a little back of
      Lightfoot, &ldquo;I don't call it white. It has a white edge, but mostly it is
      the color of his coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now while Lightfoot had been standing there his tail had hung down, and it
      was as Johnny Chuck had said. But at Johnny's remark up flew Lightfoot's
      tail, showing only the under side. It was like a pointed white flag. With
      it held aloft that way, no one behind Lightfoot would suspect that his
      whole tail was not white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Notice how long and fluffy the hair on that tail is,&rdquo; said Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;Mrs. Lightfoot's is just like it, and this makes it very easy for
      her babies to follow her in the dark. When Lightfoot is feeding or simply
      walking about he carries it down, but when he is frightened and bounds
      away, up goes that white flag. Now look at his horns. They are not true
      horns. The latter are hollow, while these are not. Farmer Brown's cows
      have horns. Lightfoot has antlers. Just remember that. The so-called horns
      of all the Deer family are antlers and are not hollow. Notice how
      Lightfoot's curve forward with the branches or tines on the back side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course everybody looked at Lightfoot's crown as he held his head
      proudly. &ldquo;What is the matter with them?&rdquo; asked Whitefoot the Wood Mouse.
      &ldquo;They look to me as if they are covered with fur. I always supposed them
      to be hard like bone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they will be a month from now,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature, smiling
      down at Whitefoot. &ldquo;That which you call fur will come off. He will rub it
      off against the trees until his antlers are polished, and there is not a
      trace of it left. You see Lightfoot has just grown that set this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean those antlers?&rdquo; asked Danny Meadow Mouse, looking very much
      puzzled. &ldquo;Didn't he have any before? How could things like those grow,
      anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know that he loses his horns, I mean antlers, every year?&rdquo;
       demanded Jumper the Hare. &ldquo;I thought every one knew that. His old ones
      fell off late last winter. I know, for I saw him just afterward, and he
      looked sort of ashamed. Anyway, he didn't carry his head as proudly as he
      does now. He looked a lot like Mrs. Lightfoot; you know she hasn't any
      antlers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could hard, bony things like those grow?&rdquo; persisted Danny Meadow
      Mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I will have to explain,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;They were not
      hard and bony when they were growing. Just as soon as Lightfoot's old
      antlers dropped off, the new ones started. They sprouted out of his head
      just as plants sprout out of the ground, and they were soft and very
      tender and filled with blood, just as all parts of your body are. At first
      they were just two round knobs. Then these pushed out and grew and grew.
      Little knobs sprang out from them and grew to make the branches you see
      now. All the time they were protected by a furry skin which looks a great
      deal like what men call velvet. When Lightfoot's antlers are covered with
      this, they are said to be in the velvet state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they had reached their full size they began to shrink and harden, so
      that now they are quite hard, and very soon that velvet will begin to come
      off. When they were growing they were so tender that Lightfoot didn't move
      about any more than was necessary and kept quite by himself. He was afraid
      of injuring those antlers. By the time cool weather comes, Lightfoot will
      be quite ready to use those sharp points on anybody who gets in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Jumper has said, Mrs. Lightfoot has no antlers. Otherwise she looks
      much like Lightfoot, save that she is not quite as big. Have any of you
      ever seen her babies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; declared Jumper, who, as you know, lives in the Green Forest
      just as Lightfoot does. &ldquo;They are the dearest little things and look like
      their mother, only they have the loveliest spotted coats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to help them to remain unseen by their enemies,&rdquo; explained Old
      Mother Nature. When they lie down where the sun breaks through the trees
      and spots the ground with light they seem so much like their surroundings
      that unless they move they are not often seen even by the sharpest eyes
      that may pass close by. They lie with their little necks and heads
      stretched flat on the ground and do not move so much as a hair. You see,
      they usually are very obedient, and the first thing their mother teaches
      them is to keep perfectly still when she leaves them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they are a few months old and able to care for themselves a little,
      the spots disappear. As a rule Mrs. Lightfoot has two babies each spring.
      Once in a while she has three, but two is the rule. She is a good mother
      and always on the watch for possible danger. While they are very small she
      keeps them hidden in the deepest thickets. By the way, do you know that
      Lightfoot and Mrs. Lightfoot are fine swimmers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Happy Jack Squirrel looked the surprise he felt. &ldquo;I don't see how under
      the sun any one with little hoofed feet like Lightfoot's can swim,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless, Lightfoot is a good swimmer and fond of the water,&rdquo; replied
      Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;That is one way he has of escaping his enemies. When
      he is hard pressed by Wolves or Dogs he makes for the nearest water and
      plunges in. He does not hesitate to swim across a river or even a small
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lightfoot prefers the Green Forest where there are close thickets with
      here and there open places. He likes the edge of the Green Forest where he
      can come out in the open fields, yet be within a short distance of the
      protecting trees and bushes. He requires much water and so is usually
      found not far from a brook, pond or river. He has a favorite drinking
      place and goes to drink early in the morning and just at dusk. During the
      day he usually sleeps hidden away in a thicket or under a windfall, coming
      out late in the afternoon. He feeds mostly in the early evening. He eats
      grass and other plants, beechnuts and acorns, leaves and twigs of certain
      trees, lily pads in summer and, I am sorry to say, delights to get into
      Farmer Brown's garden, where almost every green thing tempts him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like so many others he has a hard time in winter, particularly when the
      snows are deep. Then he and Mrs. Lightfoot and their children live in what
      is called a yard. Of course it isn't really a yard such as Farmer Brown
      has. It is simply a place where they keep the snow trodden down in paths
      which cross and cross, and is made where there is shelter and food. The
      food is chiefly twigs and leaves of evergreen trees. As the snow gets
      deeper and deeper they become prisoners in the yard until spring comes to
      melt the snow and set them free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lightfoot depends for safety more on his nose and ears than on his eyes.
      His sense of smell is wonderful, and when he is moving about he usually
      goes up wind; that is, in the direction from which the wind is blowing.
      This is so that it will bring to him the scent of any enemy that may be
      ahead of him. He is very clever and cunning. Often before lying down to
      rest he goes back a short distance to a point where he can watch his
      trail, so that if any one is following it he will have warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His greatest enemy is the hunter with his terrible gun. How any one can
      look into those great soft eyes of Lightfoot and then even think of trying
      to kill him is more than I can understand. Dogs are his next worst enemies
      when he lives near the homes of men. When he lives where Wolves, Panthers
      and Bears are found, he has to be always on the watch for them. Tufty the
      Lynx is ever on the watch for Lightfoot's babies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The White-tailed Deer is the most widely distributed of all the Deer
      family. He is found from the Sunny South to the great forests of the North&mdash;everywhere
      but in the vast open plains of the middle of this great country. That is,
      he used to be. In many places he has been so hunted by man that he has
      disappeared. When he lives in the Sunny South he never grows to be as big
      as when he lives in the North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the great mountains of the Far West lives a cousin, Blacktail, also
      called Columbian Blacktailed Deer, and another cousin, Forkhorn the Mule
      Deer. Blacktail is nearly the size of Lightfoot. He is not quite so
      graceful, his ears are larger, being much like those of Forkhorn the Mule
      Deer, to whom he is closely related, and his tail is wholly black on the
      upper surface. It is from this he gets his name. His antlers vary,
      sometimes being much like those of Lightfoot and again like those of
      Forkhorn. He is a lover of dense forests and is not widely distributed. He
      is not nearly so smart as Lightfoot in outwitting hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forkhorn the Mule Deer, sometimes called Jumping Deer, is larger than
      Lightfoot and much more heavily built. His big ears, much like those of a
      Mule, have won for him the name of Mule Deer. His face is a dull white
      with a black patch on the forehead and a black band under the chin. His
      tail is rather short and is not broad at the base like Lightfoot's. It is
      white with a black tip. Because of this he is often called Blacktailed
      Deer, but this is wrong because that name belongs to his cousin, the true
      Blacktail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forkhorn's antlers are his glory. They are even finer than Lightfoot's.
      The prongs, or tines, are in pairs like the letter Y instead of in a row
      as are those of Lightfoot, and usually there are two pairs on each antler.
      Forkhorn prefers rough country and there he is very much at home, his
      powers of jumping enabling him to travel with ease where his enemies find
      it difficult to follow. Like Blacktail he is not nearly so clever as
      Lightfoot the White-tail and so is more easily killed by hunters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these members of the Deer family belong to the round-horn branch, and
      are very much smaller than the members of the flat-horn branch. But there
      is one who in size makes all the others look small indeed. It is Bugler
      the Elk, or Wapiti, of whom I shall tell you to-morrow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI Bugler, Flathorns and Wanderhoof
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lightfoot the Deer was the first one on hand the next morning. In fact, he
      arrived before sun-up and, lying down in a little thicket close at hand,
      made himself very comfortable to wait for the opening of school. You see,
      not for anything would he have missed that lesson about his big cousins.
      There the others found him when they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Deer family,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;is divided into two branches&mdash;the
      round-horned and the flat-horned. I have told you about the round-horned
      Deer with the exception of the largest and noblest, Bugler the Elk. He is
      commonly called Elk, but his right name is Wapiti.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bugler is found only in the great mountains of the Far West, but once,
      before hunters with terrible guns came, Elk were found in nearly all parts
      of this country excepting the Far South and the Far North&mdash;even on
      the great plains. Now Bugler lives only in the forests of the great
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How big is he?&rdquo; asked Lightfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So big that beside him you would look very small,&rdquo; replied Old Mother
      Nature. &ldquo;Have you ever seen Farmer Brown's Horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lightfoot nodded. &ldquo;Well, Bugler stands as high as that Horse,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature. &ldquo;He isn't as heavy, for his body is of different shape, not
      so big around, but at that he weighs three times as much as you do. In
      summer his coat is a light yellowish-brown, becoming very dark on his neck
      and underneath. His legs are dark brown. The hair on his neck is long and
      coarse. His tail is very small, and around it is a large patch so light in
      color as to be almost whitish. In winter his coat becomes dark gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bugler's crowning glory are his antlers. They are very large and
      wide-spreading, sweeping backward and upward, the long prongs, or tines,
      curving upward from the front instead of from the back, as in the case of
      Lightfoot's antlers. Above each eye is a long sharp prong. So big are
      these antlers that Bugler looks almost as if he were carrying a small,
      bare tree on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big as these antlers are, they are grown in a few months for Bugler is
      like his small cousins in that he loses his antlers at the end of every
      winter and must grow a new pair. While they are growing, he hides in the
      wildest places he can find, high up on the mountains. Mrs. Bugler is at
      that time down in a valley with her baby or babies. Usually she has one,
      but sometimes twins. She has no antlers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the fall, when his antlers have hardened, Bugler moves down to join
      his family. The bigger and stronger he is, the bigger his family is, for
      he has a number of wives and they all live together in a herd or band of
      which Bugler is lord and master. He is ready and eager to fight for them,
      and terrible battles take place when another disputes his leadership. At
      this season he has a habit of stretching his neck out and emitting a
      far-reaching trumpet-like sound from which he gets the name of Bugler. It
      is a warning that he is ready to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the snows of winter come, many families get together and form great
      bands. Then they move down from the mountains in search of shelter and
      food. When a winter is very bad, many starve to death, for man has fenced
      in and made into farms much of the land where the elk once found ample
      food for winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But big as is Bugler the Elk, there is a cousin who is bigger, the
      biggest of all the Deer family. It is Flathorns the Moose. As you must
      guess by his name he is a member of the flat-horned branch of the family.
      His antlers spread widely and are flattened instead of being round. From
      the edges of the flattened part many sharp points spring out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flathorns, wearing his crown of great spreading antlers, is a noble
      appearing animal because of his great size, but when his antlers have
      dropped he is a homely fellow. Mrs. Flathorns, who has no antlers, is very
      homely. As I have said, Flathorns is the biggest member of the Deer
      family. He is quite as big as Farmer Brown's Horse and stands much higher
      at the shoulders. Indeed, his shoulders are so high that he has a decided
      hump there, for they are well above the line of his back. His neck is very
      short, large and thick, and his head is not at all like the heads of other
      members of the Deer family. Instead of the narrow, pointed face of other
      members of the Deer family, he has a broad, long face, rather more like
      that of a Horse. Towards the nose it humps up, and the great thick upper
      lip overhangs the lower one. His nose is very broad, and for his size his
      eyes are small. His ears are large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From his throat hangs a hairy fold of skin called a bell. He has a very
      short tail, so short that it is hardly noticeable. His legs are very long
      and rather large. His hoofs are large and rounded, more like those of
      Bossy the Cow than like those of Lightfoot the Deer. Seen at a little
      distance in the woods, he looks to be almost black, but really is for the
      most part dark brown. His legs are gray on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flathorns lives in the great northern forests clear across the country,
      and is especially fond of swampy places. He is fond of the water and is a
      good swimmer. In summer he delights to feed on the pads, stems and roots
      of water lilies, and his long legs enable him to wade out to get them. For
      the most part his food consists of leaves and tender twigs of young trees,
      such as striped maple, aspen, birch, hemlock, alder and willow. His great
      height enables him to reach the upper branches of young trees. When they
      are too tall for this, he straddles them and bends or breaks them down to
      get at the upper branches. His front teeth are big, broad and sharp-edged.
      With these he strips the bark from the larger branches. He also eats grass
      and moss. Because of his long legs and short neck he finds it easiest to
      kneel when feeding on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big as he is, he can steal through thick growth without making a sound.
      He does not jump like other Deer, but travels at an awkward trot which
      takes him over the ground very fast. In the winter when snow is deep, the
      Moose family lives in a yard such as I told you Lightfoot makes. The
      greatest enemy of Flathorns is the hunter, and from being much hunted
      Flathorns has learned to make the most of his ears, eyes and nose. He is
      very smart and not easily surprised. When wounded he will sometimes attack
      man, and occasionally when not wounded. Then he strikes with his
      sharp-edged front hoofs, and they are terrible weapons. Altogether he is a
      wonderful animal, and it is a matter for sorrow that man persists in
      hunting him merely to get his wonderful head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In parts of these same northern forests lives another big member of the
      Deer family, Wanderhoof the Woodland Caribou. He is bigger than Lightfoot
      the Deer, but smaller than Bugler the Elk, rather an awkward-looking
      fellow. His legs are quite long but stout. His neck is rather short, and
      instead of carrying his head proudly as does Lightfoot, he carries it
      stretched out before him or hanging low. The hair on the lower part of his
      neck is long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanderhoof wears a coat of brown. His neck being much lighter or almost
      gray. He has an undercoat which is very thick and woolly. In winter his
      whole coat becomes grayish and his neck white. Above each hoof is a band
      of white. His tail is very short, and white on the under side. His antlers
      are wonderful, being very long and both round and flat. That is, parts of
      them are round and parts flattened. They have more prongs than those of
      any other Deer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hoofs are very large, deeply slit, and cup-shaped. When he walks they
      make a snapping or clicking sound. These big feet were given him for a
      purpose. He is very fond of boggy ground, and because of these big feet
      and the fact that the hoofs spread when he steps, he can walk safely where
      others would sink in. This is equally true in snow, when they serve as
      snowshoes. As a result he is not forced to live in yards as are Lightfoot
      and Flathorns when the snow is deep, but goes where he pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very fond of the water and delights to splash about in it, and is a
      splendid swimmer. His hair floats him so that when swimming he is higher
      out of water than any other member of the family. In winter he lives in
      the thickest parts of the forest among the hemlocks and spruces, and feeds
      on the mosses and lichens which grow on the trees. In summer he moves to
      the open, boggy ground around shallow lakes where moss covers the ground,
      and on this he lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a great wanderer, hence his name Wanderhoof. Mrs. Caribou has
      antlers, wherein she differs from Mrs. Lightfoot, Mrs. Flathorns and Mrs.
      Bugler. Wanderhoof is fond of company and usually is found with many
      companions of his own kind. When they are moving from their summer home to
      their winter home, or back again, they often travel in very large bands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the Far North beyond the great forests Wanderhoof has a cousin who
      looks very much like him, called the Barren Ground Caribou. The name comes
      from the fact that way up there little excepting moss grows, and on this
      the Caribou lives. In summer this Caribou is found almost up to the Arctic
      Ocean, moving southward in great herds as the cold weather approaches. No
      other animals of to-day get together in such great numbers. In the extreme
      North is another Caribou, called Peary's Caribou, whose coat is wholly
      white. The Caribou are close cousins of the Reindeer and look much like
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All male members of the smaller Deer are called bucks, the female members
      are called does, and the young are called fawns. All male members of the
      big Deer, such as Bugler the Elk, Flathorns the Moose and Wanderhoof the
      Caribou, are called bulls. The females are called cows and the young are
      called calves. All members of the Deer family, with the exception of the
      Barren Ground Caribou, are forest-loving animals and are seldom seen far
      from the sheltering woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, I think, will do for the Deer family. To-morrow I shall tell you
      about Thunderfoot the Bison, Fleetfoot the Antelope, and Longcoat the Musk
      Ox.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII Thunderfoot, Fleetfoot and Longcoat
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who remembers the name of the order to which all members of the Deer
      family belong?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember what it means, but not the name,&rdquo; spoke up Happy Jack
      Squirrel. &ldquo;It means hoofed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Un&mdash;Un-Ungu&mdash;&rdquo; began Peter Rabbit and then stopped. For
      the life of him he couldn't think of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ungulata,&rdquo; Old Mother Nature finished for him. &ldquo;And Happy Jack has the
      meaning right. It is the order to which all hoofed animals belong. There
      are several families in the order, one of which you already have learned
      about&mdash;the Deer family. Now comes the family of Cattle and Sheep. It
      is called the Bovidae family, and the biggest and most important member is
      Thunderfoot the Bison, commonly called Buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunderfoot is more closely related to Bossy, Farmer Brown's Cow, than
      are the members of the Deer family, for he has true horns, not antlers.
      These are hollow and are not dropped each year, but are carried through
      life. Mrs. Thunderfoot has them also. The horns grow out from the sides of
      the forehead and then curve upward and inward, and are smooth and sharp.
      They are never branched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunderfoot is a great, heavy fellow the size of Farmer Brown's Ox, and
      has a great hump on his shoulders. He carries his head low and from his
      throat hangs a great beard. His head is large and is so covered with
      thick, curly hair that it appears much larger than it really is. His tail
      is rather short and ends in a tassel of hair. The hair on his body and
      hind quarters is short and light brown, but on his shoulders and neck and
      his fore legs to the knees it is long and shaggy, dark brown above and
      almost black below.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must be a queer looking fellow,&rdquo; spoke up Chatterer the Red Squirrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;The front half of him looks so much
      bigger than the rear half that it almost seems as if they didn't belong
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he eat?&rdquo; asked Jumper the Hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grass,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature promptly. &ldquo;He grazes just as does
      Bossy. When the weather becomes hot his thick coat, although much of it
      has been shed, becomes most uncomfortable. Also he is tormented by flies.
      Then he delights in rolling in mud until he is plastered with it from head
      to feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many years ago there were more Bison than any other large animal in this
      country, and they were found in nearly all parts of it. Some lived in the
      woods and were called Wood Buffaloes, but the greatest number lived on the
      great plains and prairies, where the grass was plentiful. I have told you
      about the great herd of Barren Ground Caribou, but this is nothing to the
      great herds of Bison that used to move north or south, according to the
      season, across the great prairies. In the fall they moved south. In the
      spring they moved north, following the new grass as it appeared. When they
      galloped, the noise of their feet was like thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the hunters with terrible guns came and killed them for their skins,
      killed them by hundreds of thousands, and in just a few years those great
      herds became only a memory. Thunderfoot, once Lord of the Prairies, was
      driven out of all his great kingdom, and the Bison, from being the most
      numerous of all large animals, is to-day reduced to just a few hundreds,
      and most of these are kept in parks by man. Barely in time did man make
      laws to protect Thunderfoot. Without this protection he would not exist
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A close neighbor of Thunderfoot's in the days when he was Lord of the
      Prairies was Fleetfoot the Antelope. Fleetfoot is about the size of a
      small Deer, and in his graceful appearance reminds one of Lightfoot, for
      he has the same trim body and long slim legs. He is built for speed and
      looks it. From just a glance at him you would know him for a runner just
      as surely as a look at Jumper the Hare would tell you that he must travel
      in great bounds. The truth is, Fleetfoot is the fastest runner among all
      my children in this country. Not one can keep up with him in a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleetfoot's coat is a light yellowish-brown on the back and white
      underneath. His forehead is brown and the sides of his face white. His
      throat and under side of his neck are white, crossed by two bands of
      brown. His hoofs, horns and eyes are black, and there is a black spot
      under each ear. Near the end of his nose he is also black, and down the
      back of his neck is a black line of stiff longer hairs. A large white
      patch surrounds his short tail. Who remembers what I told you about
      Antelope Jack, the big Jack Hare of the Southwest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; cried Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, Jumper?&rdquo; asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that he has a way of making the white of his sides seem to grow
      so that he seems almost all white, and can signal his friends in this
      way,&rdquo; replied Jumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;I am glad to find that you
      remember so well. Fleetfoot does the same thing with this white patch
      around his tail. The hairs are quite long and he can make them spread out
      so that that white patch becomes much larger, and when he is running it
      can be seen flashing in the sun long after he is so far away that nothing
      else of him can be seen. His eyes are wonderfully keen, so by means of
      these white patches he and his friends can signal each other when they are
      far apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleetfoot has true horns, but they are unlike any other horns in that
      they are shed every year, just like the antlers of the Deer family. They
      grow straight up just over the eyes, are rather short, and fork. One
      branch is much shorter than the other, and the longer one is turned over
      at the end like a hook. From these horns he gets the name of Pronghorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When running from danger he carries his head low and makes long leaps.
      When not frightened he trots and holds his head high and proudly. He
      prefers flat open country, and there is no more beautiful sight on all the
      great plains of the West than a band of Fleetfoot and his friends. He is
      social and likes the company of his own kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time was when these beautiful creatures were almost as numerous as
      the Bison, but like the latter they have been killed until now there is
      real danger that unless man protects them better than he is doing there
      will come a day when the last Antelope will be killed, and one of the most
      beautiful and interesting of all my children will be but a memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of great sadness in Old Mother Nature's voice. For a few
      minutes no one spoke. All were thinking of the terrible thing that had
      happened at the hands of man to the great hosts of two of the finest
      animals in all this great land, the Bison and Antelope, and there was
      bitterness in the heart of each one, for there was not one there who did
      not himself have cause to fear man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature was the first to break the silence. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I
      will tell you of the oddest member of the Cattle and Sheep family. It is
      Longcoat the Musk Ox, and he appears to belong wholly neither to the
      Cattle nor the Sheep branch of the family, but to both. He connects the
      two branches in appearance, reminding one somewhat of a small Bison and at
      the same time having things about him very like a Sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longcoat the Musk Ox lives in the Farthest North, the land of snow and
      ice. He has been found very near the Arctic Ocean, and how he finds enough
      to eat in the long winter is a mystery to those who know that snow-covered
      land. He is a heavily built, round-bodied animal with short, stout legs,
      shoulders so high that they form a hump, a low-hung head and sheeplike
      face, heavy horns which are flat and broad at the base and meet at the
      center of the forehead, sweeping down on each side of the head and then
      turning up in sharp points. His tail is so short that it is hidden in the
      long hair which covers him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This hair is so long that it hangs down on each side so that often it
      touches the snow and hides his legs nearly down to his feet. In color it
      is very dark-brown, almost black, and on his sides is straight. But on his
      shoulders it is curly. In the middle of the back is a patch of shorter
      dull-gray hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Underneath this coat of long hair is another coat of woolly, fine
      light-brown hair, so close that neither cold nor rain can get through it.
      It is this warm coat that makes it possible for him to live in that
      terribly cold region. He is about twice as heavy as a big Deer. At times
      he gives off a musky odor, and it is from this that he gets his name of
      Musk Ox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Longcoat is seldom found alone, but usually with a band of his friends.
      This is partly for protection from his worst enemies, the Wolves. When the
      latter appear, Longcoat and his friends form a circle with their heads
      out, and it is only a desperately hungry Wolf that will try to break
      through that line of sharp-pointed horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In rough, rocky country he is as sure-footed as a Sheep. In the short
      summer of that region he finds plenty to eat, but in winter he has to paw
      away the snow to get at the moss and other plants buried beneath it.
      Practically all other animals living so far North have white coats, but
      Longcoat retains his dark coat the year through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, how time flies! This is all for to-day. To-morrow I will tell you of
      two wonderful mountain climbers who go with ease where even man cannot
      follow.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII Two Wonderful Mountain Climbers
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter, you have been up in the Old Pasture many times, so you must have
      seen the Sheep there,&rdquo; said Old Mother Nature, turning to Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. Of course,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;They seem to me rather stupid
      creatures. Anyway they look stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know the leader of the flock, the big ram with curling horns,&rdquo;
       continued Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded, and Old Mother Nature went on. &ldquo;Just imagine him with a
      smooth coat of grayish-brown instead of a white woolly one, and immense
      curling horns many times larger than those he now has. Give him a large
      whitish or very light-yellowish patch around a very short tail. Then you
      will have a very good idea of one of those mountain climbers I promised to
      tell you about, one of the greatest mountain climbers in all the Great
      World&mdash;Bighorn the Mountain Sheep, also called Rocky Mountain Bighorn
      and Rocky Mountain Sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bighorn is a true Sheep and lives high up among the rocks of the highest
      mountains of the Far West. Like all members of the order to which he
      belongs his feet are hoofed, but they are hoofs which never slip, and he
      delights to bound along the edges of great cliffs and in making his way up
      or down them where it looks as if it would be impossible for even
      Chatterer the Red Squirrel to find footing, to say nothing of such a big
      fellow as Bighorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mountains where he makes his home are so high that the tops of many
      of them are in the clouds and covered with snow even in summer. Above the
      line where trees can no longer grow Bighorn spends his summers, coming
      down to the lower hills only when the snow becomes so deep that he cannot
      paw down through it to get food. His eyesight is wonderful and from his
      high lookout he watches for enemies below, and small chance have they of
      approaching him from that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When alarmed he bounds away gracefully as if there were great springs in
      his legs, and his great curled horns are carried as easily as if they were
      nothing at all. Down rock slopes, so steep that a single misstep would
      mean a fall hundreds of feet, he bounds as swiftly and easily as Lightfoot
      the Deer bounds through the woods, leaping from one little jutting point
      of rock to another and landing securely as if he were on level ground. He
      climbs with equal ease where man would have to crawl and cling with
      fingers and toes, or give up altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bighorn does not have the great curling horns. Instead she is armed
      with short, sharp-pointed horns, like spikes. Her young are born in the
      highest, most inaccessible place she can find, and there they have little
      to fear save one enemy, King Eagle. Only such an enemy, one with wings,
      can reach them there. Bighorn and Mrs. Bighorn, because of their size,
      nothing to dread from these great birds, but helpless little lambs are
      continually in danger of furnishing King Eagle with the dinner he prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when driven to the lower slopes and hills by storms and snow does
      Bighorn have cause to fear four-footed enemies. Then Puma the Panther must
      be watched for, and lower down Howler the Wolf. But Bighorn's greatest
      enemy, and one he fears most, is the same one so many others have sad
      cause to fear&mdash;the hunter with his terrible gun. The terrible gun can
      kill where man himself cannot climb, and Bighorn has been persistently
      hunted for his head and wonderful horns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some people believe that Bighorn leaps from cliffs and alights on those
      great horns, but this not true. Whenever he leaps he alights on those sure
      feet of his, not on his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way up in the extreme northwest corner of this country, in a place called
      Alaska, is a close cousin whose coat is all white and whose horns are
      yellow and more slender and wider spreading. He called the Dall Mountain
      Sheep. Farther south, but not as far south as the home of Bighorn, is
      another cousin whose coat is so dark that he is sometimes called the Black
      Mountain Sheep. His proper name is Stone's Mountain Sheep. In the
      mountains between these two is another cousin with a white head and dark
      body called Fannin's sheep. All these cousins are closely related and in
      their habits are much alike. Of them all, Bighorn the Rocky Mountain Sheep
      is the best known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; said Peter Rabbit, &ldquo;that way up there on those high
      mountains Bighorn would be very lonesome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;Bighorn doesn't care for neighbors as you do,
      Peter,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But even up in those high rocky retreats among the
      clouds he has a neighbor as sure-footed as himself, one who stays winter
      as well as summer on the mountain tops. It is Billy the Rocky Mountain
      Goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Billy is as awkward-looking as he moves about as Bighorn is graceful, but
      he will go where even Bighorn will hesitate to follow. His hoofs are small
      and especially planned for walking in safety on smooth rock and
      ice-covered ledges. In weight he is about equal to Lightfoot the Deer, but
      he doesn't look in the least like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place he has a hump on his shoulders much like the humps of
      Thunderfoot the Bison and Longcoat the Musk Ox. Of course this means that
      he carries his head low. His face is very long and from beneath his chin
      hangs a white beard. From his forehead two rather short, slim, black horns
      stand up with a little curve backward. His coat is white and the hair is
      long and straight. Under this long white coat he wears a thick coat of
      short, woolly, yellowish-white fur which keeps him warm in the coldest
      weather. He seldom leaves his beloved mountain-tops, even in the worst
      weather of winter, as Bighorn sometimes does, but finds shelter among the
      rocks. The result is that he has practically no enemies save man to fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Often he spends the summer where the snow remains all the year through
      and his white coat is a protection from the keenest eyes. You see, when
      not moving, he looks in the distance for all the world like a patch of
      snow on the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not having a handsome head or wonderful horns he has not been hunted by
      man quite so much as has Bighorn, and therefore is not so alert and wary.
      Both he and Bighorn are more easily approached from above than from below,
      because they do not expect danger from above and so do not keep so sharp a
      watch in that direction. The young are sometimes taken by King Eagle, but
      otherwise Billy Goat's family has little to fear from enemies, always
      excepting the hunter with his terrible gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now told you of the members of the cattle and Sheep family, what
      they look like and where they live and how. There is still one more member
      of the order Ungulata and this one is in a way related to another member
      of Farmer Brown's barnyard. I will leave you to guess which one. What is
      it, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, in just what part of the Far West are the mountains where
      Billy Goat lives?&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chiefly in the northern part,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;In the
      Northwest these mountains are very close to the ocean and Billy does not
      appear to mind in the least the fogs that roll in, and seems to enjoy the
      salt air. Sometimes there he comes down almost to the shore. Are there any
      more questions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were none, so school was dismissed for the day. Peter didn't go
      straight home. Instead he went up to the Old Pasture for another look at
      the old ram there and tried to picture to himself just what Bighorn must
      look like. Especially he looked at the hoofs of the old ram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is queer,&rdquo; muttered Peter, &ldquo;how feet like those can be so safe up on
      those slippery rocks Old Mother Nature told us about. Anyway, it seems
      queer to me. But it must be so if she says it is. My, my, my, what a lot
      of strange people there are in this world! And what a lot there is to
      learn!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIX Piggy and Hardshell
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the way to school the next morning Peter Rabbit did his best to guess
      who it might be that they were to learn about that day. &ldquo;Old Mother Nature
      said that he is related to some one who lives in Farmer Brown's barnyard,&rdquo;
       said Peter to himself. &ldquo;Now who can it be?&rdquo; But try as he would, Peter
      couldn't think of any one. He asked Jumper the Hare if he had guessed who
      it could be. Jumper shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the least idea,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You know I seldom leave the Green
      Forest and I never have been over to that barnyard in my life, so of
      course I don't know who lives there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danny Meadow Mouse and Whitefoot the Wood Mouse were no wiser, nor was
      Johnny Chuck. But Chatterer the Red Squirrel, it was plain to see, was
      quite sure he knew who it was. Chatterer had been over to Farmer Brown's
      so often to steal corn from the corn crib that he knew all about that
      barnyard and who lived there. But though Peter and the others teased him
      to tell them he wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Old Mother Nature asked who had guessed to whom she had referred
      Chatterer was the only one to reply. &ldquo;I think you must have meant the Pig
      who is always rooting about and grunting in that barnyard,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your guess is right, Chatterer,&rdquo; she replied, smiling at the little
      red-coated rascal, &ldquo;and this morning I will tell you a little about a
      relative of his who doesn't live in a barnyard, but lives in the forest,
      as free and independent as you are. It is Piggy the Peccary, known as the
      Collared Peccary, also called Wild Pig, Muskhog, Texas Peccary and
      Javelina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a true Pig and in shape resembles that lazy, fat fellow in Farmer
      Brown's barnyard when he was little. You would know him for a Pig right
      away if you should see him. But in every other way excepting his habit of
      rooting up the ground with his nose, he is a wholly different fellow. For
      one thing his legs, though short, are more slender and he is a fast
      runner. There isn't a lazy bone in him, and he is too active to grow fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His head is large and his nose long, and his tail is almost no tail at
      all; it is just a little rounded knob, as if he had at one time had a tail
      and it had been cut off. His hair is coarse and stiff, the kind of hair
      called bristles. From the back of his head along his back the bristles are
      long and stout. They are black at the tips so that he appears to have a
      black back. When Piggy is angry he raises these long bristles so that they
      stand straight up and this gives him a very fierce appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His color is so dark a gray that at a distance he appears black. Indeed
      he is black on many parts of him. Just back of the neck a whitish band
      crosses the shoulders, and this is why he is called the Collared Peccary.
      You see he seems to be wearing a collar. On each jaw are two great pointed
      teeth called tusks, the two upper ones so long that they project beyond
      the lips. These tusks are Piggy's weapons, and very good ones they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The home of Piggy the Peccary is in the hot southwestern part of this
      country, where live Jaguar and Ocelot, the beautiful spotted members of
      the Cat family. They are two of his enemies. He never likes to be alone,
      but lives with a band of his friends and they roam about together. He is
      found on the plains and among low hills, in swamps and dense forests, and
      among the thickets of cactus and other thorny plants that grow in dry
      regions. Plenty of food and shelter from the hot sun seem to be the main
      things with Piggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he eat?&rdquo; asked Peter Rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature laughed. &ldquo;It would be easier, Peter, to tell you what he
      doesn't eat,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He eats everything eatable, nuts, fruits, seeds,
      roots and plants of various kinds, insects, Frogs, Lizards, Snakes and any
      small animals he can catch. Sometimes he does great damage to gardens and
      crops planted by man. He delights to root in the earth with his nose and
      often turns over much ground in this way, searching for roots good to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the lower part of his back he carries a little bag of musky scent, and
      from this he gets the name of Muskhog. While as a rule he wisely runs from
      danger, he is no coward, and will fight fiercely when cornered. His
      friends at once rush to help him and surround the enemy, who is usually
      glad to climb a tree to escape their gnashing tusks. However, he is not
      the fierce animal he has been reported to be, ready to attack unprovoked.
      He will run away if he can. Mr. and Mrs. Peccary have two babies at a
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the last of the hoofed animals and the last but one of the land
      animals of this great country, so you see we are almost to the end of
      school. This last one is perhaps the queerest of all. It is Hardshell the
      Armadillo, and belongs to the order of Edentata, which means toothless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you men to say that there are animals with no teeth at all?&rdquo; asked
      Happy Jack Squirrel, looking as if he couldn't believe such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother Nature nodded. &ldquo;That is just what I mean,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;There are
      animals without any teeth, though not in this country, and others with so
      few teeth that they have been put in the same order with the wholly
      toothless ones. Hardshell the Armadillo is one of these. He has no teeth
      at all in the front of his mouth and such teeth as he has got do not
      amount to much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you call him Hardshell?&rdquo; asked Peter impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because instead of a coat of fur he wears a coat of shell,&rdquo; replied Old
      Mother Nature, and then laughed right out at the funny expressions on the
      faces before her. It was quite clear that Peter and his friends were
      having hard work to believe she was in earnest. They suspected her of
      joking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you mean that he lives in a sort of house that he carries
      with him like Spotty the Turtle?&rdquo; ventured Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shell, but not like that of Spotty,&rdquo; explained Old Mother Nature.
      &ldquo;Spotty's shell is all one piece, but the Armadillo's shell is jointed, so
      that he can roll up like a ball. Spotty isn't a mammal, as are all of you
      and all those we have been learning about, but is a reptile. Hardshell the
      Armadillo, on the other hand, is a true mammal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all I can say is that he must be a mighty queer looking fellow,&rdquo;
       declared Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature. &ldquo;He is about the size of Unc' Billy
      Possum, and if you can imagine a pig of about that size with very short
      legs, a long tapering tail, feet with toes and long claws and a shell
      covering his whole body, the front of his face and even his tail, you will
      have something of an idea what he looks like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives down in the hot Southwest where Piggy the Peccary lives. His
      coat of shell is yellowish in color and is divided in the middle of his
      body into nine narrow bands or joints. Because of this he is called the
      Nine-banded Armadillo. In the countries to the south of this he has a
      cousin with three bands and another with six.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardshell's head is very long and he carries it pointed straight down.
      His small eyes are set far back, and at the top of his head are rather
      large upright ears. The shell of his tail is divided into many jointed
      rings so that he can move it at will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His tongue is long and sticky. This is so that he can run it out for some
      distance and sweep up the Ants and insects on which he largely lives. His
      eyesight and hearing are not very good, and having such a heavy, stiff
      coat he is a poor runner. But he is a good digger. This means, of course,
      that he makes his home in a hole in the ground. When frightened he makes
      for this, but if overtaken by an enemy he rolls up into a ball and is safe
      from all save those with big and strong enough teeth to break through the
      joints of his shell. He eats some vegetable matter and is accused of
      eating the eggs of ground-nesting birds, and of dead decayed flesh he may
      find. However, his food consists chiefly of Ants, insects of various
      kinds, and worms. He is a harmless little fellow and interesting because
      he is so queer. He is sometimes killed and eaten by man and his flesh is
      considered very good. He has from four to eight babies in the early
      spring. The baby Armadillo has a soft, tough skin instead of a shell, and
      as it grows it hardens until by the time it is fully grown it has become a
      shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this finishes the lessons about the land animals or mammals. There
      are other mammals who live in the ocean, which is the salt water which
      surrounds the land, and which, I guess, none of you have ever seen. Some
      of these come on shore and some never do. To-morrow I will tell you just a
      little about them, so that you will know something about all the animals
      of this great country which is called North America. That is, I will if
      you want me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do! Of course we do!&rdquo; cried Peter Rabbit, and it is plain that he
      spoke for all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL The Mammals of the Sea
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the last day of Old Mother Nature's school in the Green Forest, and
      when jolly, round, bright Mr. Sun had climbed high enough in the blue,
      blue sky to peep down through the trees, he found not one missing of the
      little people who had been learning so much about themselves, their
      relatives, neighbors and all the other animals in every part of this great
      country. You see, not for anything in the world would one of them
      willingly have missed that last lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you yesterday,&rdquo; began Old Mother Nature, &ldquo;that the land is
      surrounded by water, salt water, sometimes called the ocean and sometimes
      the sea. In this live the largest animals in all the Great World and many
      others, some of which sometimes come on land, and others which never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those which come on land is first cousin to Little Joe Otter and
      is named the Sea Otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives in the cold waters of the western ocean of the Far North. He
      much resembles Little Joe Otter, whom you all know, but has finer,
      handsomer fur. In fact, so handsome is his fur that he has been hunted for
      it until now. He is among the shyest and rarest of all animals, and has
      taken to living in the water practically all the time, rarely visiting
      land. He lies on his back in the water and gets his food from the bottom
      of the sea. It is chiefly clams and other shellfish. He rests on floating
      masses of sea plants. He is very playful and delights to toss pieces of
      seaweed from paw to paw as he lies floating on his back. Of course he is a
      wonderful swimmer and diver. Otherwise he couldn't live in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another who comes on land, but only for a very short distance from the
      water, is called the Walrus. He belongs to an order called Finnipedia,
      which means fin-footed. Instead of having legs and feet for walking,
      members of this order have limbs designed for swimming; these are more
      like fins or paddles than anything else and are called flippers. The
      Walrus is so big that I can give you no idea how big he is, excepting to
      say that he will weight two thousand pounds. He is simply a great mass of
      living flesh covered with a rough, very thick skin without hair. From his
      upper jaw two immense ivory tusks hang straight down, and with these he
      digs up shellfish at the bottom of the sea. It is a terrible effort for
      him to move on shore, and so he is content to stay within a few feet of
      the water. He also lives in the cold waters of the Far North amidst
      floating ice. On this he often climbs out to lie for hours. His voice is a
      deep grunt or bellowing roar. The young are born on land close to the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Sea Lions belong to this same fin-footed order. The best known of
      these are the California Sea Lion and the Fur Seal, which is not a true
      Seal. The California Sea Lion is also called the Barking Sea Lion because
      of its habit of barking, and is the best known of the family. It is
      frequently seen on the rocks along the shore and on the islands off the
      western coast. These Sea Lions are sleek animals, exceedingly graceful in
      the water. They have long necks and carry their heads high. They are
      covered with short coarse hair and have small, sharp-pointed ears. Their
      front flippers have neither hair nor claws, but their hind flippers have
      webbed toes. They are able to move about on land surprisingly well for
      animals lacking regular legs and feet, and can climb on and over rocks
      rapidly. Naturally they are splendid swimmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The largest member of the family is the Steller Sea Lion, who sometimes
      grows to be almost as big as a Walrus. He is not sleek and graceful like
      his smaller cousin, but has an enormously thick neck and heavy shoulders.
      His voice is a roar rather than a bark. The head of an old Sea Lion is so
      much like that of a true Lion that the name Sea Lion has been given this
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most valuable member of the family, so far as man is concerned, is
      the Fur Seal, also called Sea Bear. It is very nearly the size and form of
      the California Sea Lion, but under the coarse outer hair, which is gray in
      color, is a wonderful soft, fine, brown fur and for this the Fur Seal has
      been hunted so persistently that there was real danger that soon the very
      last one would be killed. Now wise and needed laws protect the Fur Seals
      on their breeding grounds, which are certain islands in the Far North. The
      young of all members of this family are born on shore, but soon take to
      the water. The Fur Seal migrates just as the birds do, but always returns
      to the place of its birth. Man and the Polar Bear are its enemies on land
      and ice, and the Killer Whale in the water. Mr. Fur Seal always has many
      wives and this is true of the other members of the Sea Lion family and of
      the Walrus. The males are three or four times the size of the females.
      Among themselves the males are fierce fighters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The true Seals are short-necked, thick-bodied, and have rather round
      heads with no visible ears. The Walrus and Sea Lions can turn their hind
      flippers forward to use as feet on land, but this the true Seals cannot
      do. Therefore they are more clumsy out of water. Their front flippers are
      covered with hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one best known is the Harbor or Leopard Seal. It is found along both
      coasts, often swimming far up big rivers. It is one of the smallest
      members of the family. Sometimes it is yellowish-gray spotted with black
      and sometimes dark brown with light spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Ringed Seal is about the same size or a little smaller than the
      Harbor Seal and is found as far north as it can find breathing holes in
      the ice. You know all these animals breathe air just as land animals do.
      This Seal looks much like the Harbor Seal, but is a little more slender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another member of the family is the Harp, Saddle-back or Greenland Seal.
      He is larger than the other two and has a black head and gray body with a
      large black ring on the back. The female is not so handsome, being merely
      spotted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The handsomest Seal is the Ribbon Seal. He is about the size of his
      cousin the Harbor Seal. He is also called the Harlequin Seal. Sometimes
      his coat is blackish-brown and sometimes yellowish-gray, but always he has
      a band of yellowish-white, like a broad ribbon, from his throat around
      over the top of his head, and another band which starts on his chest and
      goes over his shoulder, curves down and finally goes around his body not
      far above the hind flippers. Only the male is so marked. This Seal is
      rather rare. Like most of the others it lives in the cold waters of the
      Far North.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The largest of the Seals is the Elephant Seal, once numerous, but killed
      by man until now there are few members of this branch of the family. He is
      a tremendous fellow and has a movable nose which hangs several inches
      below his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The queerest-looking member of the family is the Hooded Seal. Mr. Seal of
      this branch of the family is rather large, and on top of his nose he
      carries a large bag of skin which he can fill with air until he looks as
      if he were wearing a queer hood or bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Seals complete the list of animals which live mostly in the water but
      come out on land or ice at times. Now I will tell you of a true mammal,
      warm-blooded, just as you are, and air-breathing, but which never comes on
      land. This is the Manatee or Sea Cow. It lives in the warm waters of the
      Sunny South, coming up from the sea in the big rivers. It is a very large
      animal, sometimes growing as big as a medium-sized Walrus. The head is
      round, somewhat like that of a Seal. The lips are thick and big, the upper
      one split in the middle. The eyes are small. It has but two flippers, and
      these are set in at the shoulders. Instead of hind flippers, such as the
      Seals and Sea Lions have, the Manatee has a broad, flattened and rounded
      tail which is used as a propeller, just as fish use their tails. The neck
      is short and large. In the water the Manatee looks black. The skin is
      almost hairless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This curious animal lives on water plants. Sometimes it will come close
      to a river bank and with head and shoulders out of water feed on the
      grasses which hang down from the bank. The babies are, of course, born in
      the water, as the Manatee never comes on shore. Now I think this will end
      to-day's lesson and the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit hopped up excitedly. &ldquo;You said that the largest animals in
      the world live in the sea, and you haven't told us what they are,&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough, Peter,&rdquo; replied Old Mother Nature pleasantly. &ldquo;The largest
      living animal is a Whale, a true mammal and not a fish at all, as some
      people appear to think. There are several kinds of Whales, some of them
      comparatively small and some the largest animals in the world, so large
      that I cannot give you any idea of how big they are. Beside one of these,
      the biggest Walrus would look like a baby. But the Whales do not belong
      just to this country, so I think we will not include them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we will close school. I hope you have enjoyed learning as much as I
      have enjoyed teaching, and I hope that what you have learned will be of
      use to you as long as you live. The more knowledge you possess the better
      fitted for your part in the work of the Great World you will be. Don't
      forget that, and never miss a chance to learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so ended Old Mother Nature's school in the Green Forest. One by one
      her little pupils thanked her for all she had taught them, and then
      started for home. Peter Rabbit was the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know ever and ever so much more than I did when I first came to you,
      but I guess that after all I know very little of all there is to know,&rdquo;
       said he shyly, which shows that Peter really had learned a great deal.
      Then he started for the dear Old Briar-patch, lipperty-lipperty-lip.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
